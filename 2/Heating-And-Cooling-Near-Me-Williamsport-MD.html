<p>All heater have some level of air filtering. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants streaming through your system.
