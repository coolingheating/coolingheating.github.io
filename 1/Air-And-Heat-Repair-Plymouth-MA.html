<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
