<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Rockwall TX</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in house building and construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
