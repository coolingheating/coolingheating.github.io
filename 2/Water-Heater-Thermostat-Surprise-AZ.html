<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne product of a biological impurity. Biological pollutants in the house may include mold, bacteria, viruses, mites, and pollen.

<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the possibilities are good that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold enjoy wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other allergens under control.

An a/c also decreases indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -sufferers.<p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing product acquired with the house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the evaluation on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a new resident I have discovered how to recognize the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
