<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
