<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor environmental quality") describes how within air can affect a person's health, ability, and convenience to work.
