<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Rincon GA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
