<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service in Tecumseh OK</h3>

The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
