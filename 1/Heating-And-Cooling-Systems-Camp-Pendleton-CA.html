<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might observe musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
