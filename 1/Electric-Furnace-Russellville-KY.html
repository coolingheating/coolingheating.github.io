<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
