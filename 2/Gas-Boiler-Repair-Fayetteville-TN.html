<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
