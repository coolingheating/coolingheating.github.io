<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Before cooling or setting up any new heating system in a house, it is necessary to re assess and reduce the energy load of the house. A more energy efficient house will not only reduce the cost of a new system and utility bills, however it will greatly enhance the convenience of your house. Before we style and set up any systems, we arrange a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Fundamental improvements usually include adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise a number of certified house Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>
