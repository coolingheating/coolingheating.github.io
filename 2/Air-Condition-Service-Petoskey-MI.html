<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Petoskey MI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction.

The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
