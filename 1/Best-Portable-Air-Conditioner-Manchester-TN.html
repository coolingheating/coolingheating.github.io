<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, a lot of Seattleites should discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a vicious, terrible summer season.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
