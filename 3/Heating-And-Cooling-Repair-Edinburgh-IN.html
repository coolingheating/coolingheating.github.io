<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance advantage. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions due to the fact that they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
