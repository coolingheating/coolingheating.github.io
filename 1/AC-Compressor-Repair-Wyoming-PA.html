<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>

The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
