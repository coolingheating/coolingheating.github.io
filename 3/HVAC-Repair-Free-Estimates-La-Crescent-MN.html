<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, these days. While many people assume contamination is simply an outside problem, your house (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't believe sufficient about direct exposure to all the important things we place in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- immediately, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

No additional charge.<p>
