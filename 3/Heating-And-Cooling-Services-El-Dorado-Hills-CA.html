<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they place a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's probably your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to thaw your air conditioning devices. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
