<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
