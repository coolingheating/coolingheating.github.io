<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
