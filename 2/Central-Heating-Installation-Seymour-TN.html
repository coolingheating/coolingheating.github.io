<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
