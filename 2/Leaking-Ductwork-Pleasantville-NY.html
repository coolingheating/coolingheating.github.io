<p>The possibility of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends upon private sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become air-borne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to provide enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
