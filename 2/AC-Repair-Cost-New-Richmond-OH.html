<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while describing everything to me.
