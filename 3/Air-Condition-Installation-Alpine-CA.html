<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
