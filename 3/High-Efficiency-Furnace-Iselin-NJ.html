<p>A specific a/c that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air course. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space.

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
