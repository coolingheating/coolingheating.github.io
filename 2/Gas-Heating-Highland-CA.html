<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
