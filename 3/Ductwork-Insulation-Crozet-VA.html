Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
