<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>
