<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
