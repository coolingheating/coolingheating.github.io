<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter as soon as every three months. During high use months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
