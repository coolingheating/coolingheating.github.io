Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
