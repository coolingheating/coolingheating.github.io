<p>There are a few possibilities to discuss short biking in very winter. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. Sometimes, the furnace will simply run more difficult to maintain a warm environment for your house when the weather is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our professionals if you need clarity on this problem.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
