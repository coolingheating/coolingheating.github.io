<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
