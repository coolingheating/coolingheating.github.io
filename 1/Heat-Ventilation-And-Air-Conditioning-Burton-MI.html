The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
