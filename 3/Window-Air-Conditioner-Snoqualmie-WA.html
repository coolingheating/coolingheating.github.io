<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for many years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly seem higher than typical, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel costs right away, not to point out the cash you'll save money on repair expenses. If your heating unit is 25 years old or more, you can probably expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>
<p>There are many things to consider when trying to figure out how often I should change my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how typically your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right decision on how frequently your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with only one a/c filter need replacing regularly.<p>
