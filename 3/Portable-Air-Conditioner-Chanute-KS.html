While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
