<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump work on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating system) with the very same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
