<p>Heating systems resemble cars and trucks. As they age, you can replace one part just need another part changed or repaired next year. It does not take long to invest $500 simply to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air course. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>

<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental risk to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how harmful lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gas, pipes, and numerous other items.<p>

<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk with your medical professional about them. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
