I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
