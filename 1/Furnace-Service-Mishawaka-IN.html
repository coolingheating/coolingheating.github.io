<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
