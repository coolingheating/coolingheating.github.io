<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at sensible energy expenses. Load computing is described as the Handbook J calculation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, determining the correct size of unit for your home likewise depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, electricity or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific spaces.
