<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>There are many actions a homeowner can require to choose items that will prevent indoor air issues from happening - a number of them are pointed out here. First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, consider utilizing strong wood items. Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
