<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have been appropriately dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
