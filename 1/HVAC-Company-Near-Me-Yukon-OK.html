<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
