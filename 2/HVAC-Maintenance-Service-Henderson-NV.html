<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
