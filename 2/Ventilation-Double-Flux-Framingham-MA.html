<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Know in Framingham MA</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>Once every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system visually examined at least. This assessment is an important aspect of HVAC maintenance. If you do not get your system examined, you won't observe an issue until it stops working in the middle of winter. Since you will have to hunt for alternative heating sources until the system is repaired, that's the last thing you want. Regular examination and maintenance likewise helps keep it in good shape and prolongs its life.<p>
