<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists utilized different methodologies. The CMHC study gotten in touch with numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a research study, and the researchers did not manage for time invested or methods used.

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
