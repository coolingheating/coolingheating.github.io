<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, babies, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Kids might have greater exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
