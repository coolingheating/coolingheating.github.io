<h3>AC Replacement in Everett Washington</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
