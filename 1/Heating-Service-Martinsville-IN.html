<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly might be due to an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
