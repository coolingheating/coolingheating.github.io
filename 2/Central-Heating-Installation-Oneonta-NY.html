<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
