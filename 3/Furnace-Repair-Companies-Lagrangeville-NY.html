<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit.

Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not easy, since it considers not just the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
