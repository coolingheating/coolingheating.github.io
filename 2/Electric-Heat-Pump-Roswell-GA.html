Termite damage can be minimized or prevented by making sure that wood building products do not enter into direct contact with the soil and by keeping firewood far from the home. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating lawns, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be drastically minimized.<p>
