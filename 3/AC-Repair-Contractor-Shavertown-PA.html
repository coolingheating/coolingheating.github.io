I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on price. It's hard to find a truthful AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
