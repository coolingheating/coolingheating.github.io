<p>We added a brand-new 1500 sf office space to perform our workshops and required some heating. After contacting Integrity we were provided a terrific quote on a radiant flooring system. We were in a time crunch for upcoming occasion, and Tyler came right out and had us attached in a couple of days. The systems works wonderful and the brand-new office feels extremely comfortable. It was a satisfaction working with such a professional company and would extremely advise them to anyone trying to find HVAC.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth does not necessarily translate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The heating, ventilation and air conditioning organisation tends to run cold and hot. Demand heats up during the summer and winter season when customers need their HVAC systems fixed for relief against the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather condition gets here.<p>
