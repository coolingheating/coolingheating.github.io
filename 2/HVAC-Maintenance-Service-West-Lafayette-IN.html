<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally brought on by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has conducted.

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating system, you may look for a heatpump more tailored toward cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
