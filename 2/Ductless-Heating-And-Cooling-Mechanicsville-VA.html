<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Mechanicsville VA 23111</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
