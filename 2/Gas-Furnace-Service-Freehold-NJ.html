<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work effectively in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electrical energy, a heat pump is an affordable solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, however in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
