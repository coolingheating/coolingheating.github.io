<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
