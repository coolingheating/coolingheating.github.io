<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
