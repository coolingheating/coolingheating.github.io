<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to purchase it. My spouse stated that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have fulfilled in a long period of time.
