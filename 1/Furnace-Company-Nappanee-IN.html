<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, children, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults since lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the destructive effects of lead.

The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future.
