Also called mini divides" or split level Air conditionings," ductless Air conditionings can be set up in your home without all the pesky ductwork that comes with traditional HVAC systems.<p>
<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
