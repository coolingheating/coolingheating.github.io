<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
