A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
