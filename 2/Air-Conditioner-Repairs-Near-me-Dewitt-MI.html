<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Right Furnace Repair at Dewitt MI</h3>
<p>Among the main reasons a furnace will run constantly is since something is dirty or clogged Prior to trying to repair any issue, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, inspect the furnace blower for blocking and clean it. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it.
