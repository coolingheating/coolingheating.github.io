<p>Immediate results might appear after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up soon after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might notice undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak with your medical professional about them.

If micro-organisms do establish, they might spread out throughout the whole office or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
