<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 ought to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements.

<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours might end up being a source for mold development and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in hidden or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
