<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
