What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
