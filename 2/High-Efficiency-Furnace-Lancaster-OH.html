<h2>How To Hire HVAC Service in Lancaster</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of the majority of building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for resident comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at affordable energy expenses. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video footage alone. Similar to determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators used toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
