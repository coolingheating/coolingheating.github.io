<p>Professional heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC experts suggest following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
