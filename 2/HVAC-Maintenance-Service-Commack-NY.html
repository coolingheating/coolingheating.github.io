It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
