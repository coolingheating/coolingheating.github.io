<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants released by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high indoors might cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many individuals.<p>
