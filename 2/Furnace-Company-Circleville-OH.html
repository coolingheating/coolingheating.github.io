<p>The Majority Of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to thaw your cooling equipment. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
