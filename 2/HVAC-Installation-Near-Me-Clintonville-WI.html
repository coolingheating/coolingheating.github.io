<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
