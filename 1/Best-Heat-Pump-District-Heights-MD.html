<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by several thermostats.

In this case, the control system is very important to preserving an appropriate temperature level.<p>
