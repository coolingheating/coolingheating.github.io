All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the issue. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on price. It's tough to discover an honest AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
