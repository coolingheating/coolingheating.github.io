<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
