<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Winter Garden FL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
