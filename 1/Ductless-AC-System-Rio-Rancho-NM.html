<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
