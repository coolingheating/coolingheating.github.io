<p>Heating units are home appliances whose purpose is to generate heat (i.e. heat) for the structure. This can be done via central heating Such a system contains a heat, boiler, or furnace  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a furnace room in a home, or a mechanical space in a large structure.

In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location.
