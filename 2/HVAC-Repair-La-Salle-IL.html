<p>House heater are complicated systems that need the services of a contractor to set up.

<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be?

Porous materials, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold growth and must be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen.

In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities exist will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
