<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
