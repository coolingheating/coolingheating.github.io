<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Four Oaks NC</h3>
<p>A split air conditioning system might cost close to that of a standard HVAC system but has actually shown to be an alternative cost reliable option to houses that do not have ductwork. Used along with other forms of heating or cooling, such as portable or window ac system, area heating systems, or oil heaters, it can enhance the convenience of your home while keeping your monthly energy costs reasonable.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
