<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are typically only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best choice for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
