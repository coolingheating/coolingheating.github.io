<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy.
