Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
