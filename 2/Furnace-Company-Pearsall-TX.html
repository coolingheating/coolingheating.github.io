<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an abnormally high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had actually identified the trouble area in examining the bill. He dealt with the concern in one day, had changed the costs to what I considered reasonable prior to he recalled, knew what may have triggered the issue and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not happen once again.

<p>Mobile houses are generally smaller sized than stick-built homes and use significantly less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat.
