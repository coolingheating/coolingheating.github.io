<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>. Prior to choosing the installation location of a/c, numerous main aspects need to be thought about. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units must not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there should not be any challenges en route of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the area of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit should also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your home will not be effectively released outside and the productivity of the whole system will drop greatly. It is extremely recommended to install the a/c unit units in quickly accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
