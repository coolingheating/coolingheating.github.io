<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Immediate results may appear after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant results are treatable and generally short-term. Often the treatment is just eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Signs of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up not long after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
