<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Creedmoor NC</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
