Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
