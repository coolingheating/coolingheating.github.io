<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
