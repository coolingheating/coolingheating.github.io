<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Shirley MA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
