<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room a/c provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
