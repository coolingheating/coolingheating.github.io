<h2>How To Hire HVAC Companies in Somerville</h2>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
