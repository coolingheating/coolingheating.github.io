<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
