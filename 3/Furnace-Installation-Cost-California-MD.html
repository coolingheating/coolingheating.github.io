My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the abilities or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

Porous products, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold growth and should be discarded.

If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, possibilities exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
