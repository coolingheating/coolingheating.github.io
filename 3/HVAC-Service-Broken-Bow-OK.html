<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or listed below 65%.
