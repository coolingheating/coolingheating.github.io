<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ may observe moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
