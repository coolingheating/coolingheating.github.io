<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, commercial, institutional, marine and residential air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services.

Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the system and make sure that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or excessive wear to the exterior. They might recommend that you trim thick trees or bushes to make sure adequate air flow around the system.<p>

<p>Great Product! Delivery was kind of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved concerns. I would advise this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the assessment on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new homeowner I have actually found out how to determine the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
