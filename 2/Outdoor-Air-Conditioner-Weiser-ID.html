<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be induced as the outcome of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow.
