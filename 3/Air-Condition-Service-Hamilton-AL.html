<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the evaluation on a really cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health risk factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new resident I have learned how to determine the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
