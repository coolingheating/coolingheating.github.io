<h3>AC Replacement in Tonganoxie Kansas</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
