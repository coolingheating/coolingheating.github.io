<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 usually. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each room in your house, and if it develops cracks which leak, they need to be repaired. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse results. Your house will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy costs will go up. Installing brand-new ductwork for the entire home will cost approximately in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
