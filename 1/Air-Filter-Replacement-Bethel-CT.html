Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing product acquired with the house.
