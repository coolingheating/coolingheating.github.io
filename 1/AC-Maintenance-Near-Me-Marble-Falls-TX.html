First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, consider using strong wood products. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make certain that an effective wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>

Experts recommend utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and typically are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
