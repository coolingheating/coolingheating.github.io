These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect.
