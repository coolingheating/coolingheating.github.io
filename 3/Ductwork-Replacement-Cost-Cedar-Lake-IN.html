<p>Seattle furnaces can run nine months of the year. Based on the typical temperatures in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a car it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life expectancy of 15 years. Your heating unit will work hard for you, however like your cars and truck, doing regular and routine maintenance will keep it running efficiently, avoid problems, and keep your service warranty undamaged.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
