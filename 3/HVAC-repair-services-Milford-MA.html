I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
