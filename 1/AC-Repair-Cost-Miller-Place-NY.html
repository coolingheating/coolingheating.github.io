The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.

Such info can sometimes be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted.
