<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Portage MI</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. Squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly lined up or used and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
