<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
