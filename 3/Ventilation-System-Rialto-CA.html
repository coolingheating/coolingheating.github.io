<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.
