<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
