<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Umatilla OR 97882</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
