<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
