<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
