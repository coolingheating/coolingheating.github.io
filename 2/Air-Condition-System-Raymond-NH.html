<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time.
