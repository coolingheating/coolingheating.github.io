<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Colonia NJ?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
