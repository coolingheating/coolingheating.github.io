<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants.

I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
