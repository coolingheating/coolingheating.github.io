<p>Great Product! Delivery was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<h3>Floor Heating System in Sainte Genevieve MO 63670</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on uncommon occasions.<p>
