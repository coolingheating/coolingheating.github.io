Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact.
