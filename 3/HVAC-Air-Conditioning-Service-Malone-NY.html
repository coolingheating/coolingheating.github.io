Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
