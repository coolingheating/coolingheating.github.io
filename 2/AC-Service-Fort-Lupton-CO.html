<p>There are 2 primary forms of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the home heating service. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to resist current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health impacts mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not always real that the results noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the pollutants and their health effects is too restricted to figure out the levels at which the listed effects could take place.<p>
