<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.
