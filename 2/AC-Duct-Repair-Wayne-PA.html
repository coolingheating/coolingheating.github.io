<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Wayne PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<h3>HVAC Filters in Wayne PA 19087</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they diagnosed the issue and repaired extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were excellent! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my needs completely by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
