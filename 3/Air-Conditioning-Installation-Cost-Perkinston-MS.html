<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
