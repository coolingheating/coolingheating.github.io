<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
