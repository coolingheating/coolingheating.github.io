<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Steilacoom WA</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
