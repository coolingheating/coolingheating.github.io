Insulation might be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>It is especially important to take as a number of these actions as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can create high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or taking part in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might also choose to do a few of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather condition permits.<p>
