<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if required, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable service to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>
