<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
