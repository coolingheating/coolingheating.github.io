<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. First, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
