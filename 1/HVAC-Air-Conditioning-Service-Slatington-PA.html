<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season.

This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Duct are accountable for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your home, providing a comfy environment in every space.
