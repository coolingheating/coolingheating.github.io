<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have been correctly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
