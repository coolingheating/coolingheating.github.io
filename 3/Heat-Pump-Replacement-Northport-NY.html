<p>Specialist heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC professionals advise following this standard guideline when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
