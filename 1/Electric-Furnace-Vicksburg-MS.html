<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
