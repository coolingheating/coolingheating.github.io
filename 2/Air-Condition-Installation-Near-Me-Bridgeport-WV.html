<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room.
