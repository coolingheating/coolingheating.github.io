I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
