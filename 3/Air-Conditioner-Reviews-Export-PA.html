<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Export Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with two local companies for bids. While both were helpful and handy, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Rather than a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heater and situated methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these significant but small modifications in his bid. Since of current warmer summertimes and for environmental factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
