<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring removing and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Area control involves moving the pollutant source far from occupants and even relocating prone residents.<p>
<p>Some illness, like humidifier fever, are associated with direct exposure to toxins from bacteria that can grow in large building ventilation systems. However, these illness can also be traced to microbes that grow in house heating and cooling systems and humidifiers. Kids, elderly people, and individuals with breathing problems, allergic reactions, and lung diseases are particularly prone to disease-causing biological agents in the indoor air.<p>
<p>The most unsafe asbestos fibers are too little to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can build up and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these illness do not show up until several years after direct exposure started. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothes and equipment brought home from task sites.<p>
