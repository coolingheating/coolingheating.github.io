<h3>HVAC Services Company in Olathe KS 66062</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn supplied great customer care at the end of the visit by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might want to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
