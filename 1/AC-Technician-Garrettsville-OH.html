<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
