<p>There is no simple answer, but many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better service. If the existing system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is typically important to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping track of data is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
