<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner at Florence CO</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
