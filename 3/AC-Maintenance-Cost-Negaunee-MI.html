From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system.

<p>The main factor property owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services used.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants.
