<h3>Air Condition Installation in Mariposa CA 95338</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will decrease the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the abilities or tools needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician inspect the system periodically.<p>

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.
