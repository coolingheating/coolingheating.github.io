<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it via software application. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results through a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to analyze.<p>
