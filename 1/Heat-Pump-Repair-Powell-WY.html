<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up inspection outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
