In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors.
