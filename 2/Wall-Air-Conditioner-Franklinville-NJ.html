<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
