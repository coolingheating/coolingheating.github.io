<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have been correctly dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
