<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health results pointed out.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
