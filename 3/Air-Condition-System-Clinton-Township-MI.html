<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of outside or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements.
