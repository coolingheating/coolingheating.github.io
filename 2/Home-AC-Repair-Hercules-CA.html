<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Hercules CA</h3>
<p>When developing your new house a well-functioning Heating and Cooling system is vital, along with the air quality you breathe inside. We have the experience and resources necessary to assist from the planning phases through to the final installation. We use the latest software to help create your ductwork system and utilize the highest quality materials in the construction and installation.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
