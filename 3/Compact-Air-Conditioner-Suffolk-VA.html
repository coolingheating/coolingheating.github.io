<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
