A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
