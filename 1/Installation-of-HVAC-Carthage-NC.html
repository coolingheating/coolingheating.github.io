<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner in Carthage NC</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
