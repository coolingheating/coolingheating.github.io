<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
