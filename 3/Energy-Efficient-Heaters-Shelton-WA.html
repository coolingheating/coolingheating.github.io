<p>A customized a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air course. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
