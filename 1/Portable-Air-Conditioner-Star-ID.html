<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
