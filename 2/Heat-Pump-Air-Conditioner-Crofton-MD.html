<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat.
