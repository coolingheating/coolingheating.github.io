<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
