<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully.
