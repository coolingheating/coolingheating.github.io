<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up.
