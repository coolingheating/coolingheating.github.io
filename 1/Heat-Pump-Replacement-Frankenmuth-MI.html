<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a number of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
