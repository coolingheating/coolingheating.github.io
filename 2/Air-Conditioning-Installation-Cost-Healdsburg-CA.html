<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed.

Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations build up indoors.<p>
