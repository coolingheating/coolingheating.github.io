<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
