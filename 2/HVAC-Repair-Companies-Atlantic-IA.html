<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators utilized flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Atlantic IA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank.
