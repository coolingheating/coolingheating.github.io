Stale air might likewise be an issue when ventilation is not enough to represent an increase in the number of employees in the area.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
