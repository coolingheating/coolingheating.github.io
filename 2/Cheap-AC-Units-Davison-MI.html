<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if essential, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient option to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>The first a/c unit and refrigerators used combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly accidents when they leaked.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
