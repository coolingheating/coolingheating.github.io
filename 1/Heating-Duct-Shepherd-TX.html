<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
