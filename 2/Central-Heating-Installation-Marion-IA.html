<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
