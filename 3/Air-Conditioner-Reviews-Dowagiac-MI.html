<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure.
