<p>A health survey should be developed and dispersed to all worried workers. Such a tool should identify the number of individuals affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the workplace; indicate when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of specific health symptoms or health problems; recognize all devices operated in the workplace; indicate the type of outdoors air pollution; and determine potential sources of job stress.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the tools or skills essential to check refrigerant levels.

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
