<p>Specific immediate results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often tough to determine if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to take note of the time and location symptoms take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is away from the area, for instance, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>

<p>After the system has actually been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation.
