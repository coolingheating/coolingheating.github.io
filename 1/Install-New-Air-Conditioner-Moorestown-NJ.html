<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outdoors air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
