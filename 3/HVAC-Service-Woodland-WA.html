<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow restriction will lower the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>We look at ideas prior to we provide advice to replace instead of repair a heater. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Since it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you prior to you are aware it is in your house.

These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, disorientation and queasiness. The results of CO direct exposure can differ greatly from person to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
