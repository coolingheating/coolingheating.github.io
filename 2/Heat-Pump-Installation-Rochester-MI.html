<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
