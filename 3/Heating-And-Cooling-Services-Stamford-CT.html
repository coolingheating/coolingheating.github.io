<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was kind of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed problems. I would suggest this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.

<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the professionals believed they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
