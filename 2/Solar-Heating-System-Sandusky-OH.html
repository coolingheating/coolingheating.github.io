<h3>Gas Central Heating in Sandusky OH 44870</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
