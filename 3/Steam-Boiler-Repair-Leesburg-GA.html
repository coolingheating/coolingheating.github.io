<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can likewise worsen indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be polluted (since of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for instance), and the system may spread out these pollutants throughout the home.
