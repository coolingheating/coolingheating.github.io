<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
