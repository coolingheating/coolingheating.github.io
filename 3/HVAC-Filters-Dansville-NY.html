<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
