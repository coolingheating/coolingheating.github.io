<h3>AC Maintenance in Everett Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Great contractors use load-calculating software that factors in such data as the number of windows in your home, the density of insulation, the setup of the attic, and the building's orientation to the sun.

<p>Great Product! Shipment was sort of strange being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Since they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>
