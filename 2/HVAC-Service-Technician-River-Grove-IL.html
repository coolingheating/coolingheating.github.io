<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
