<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution.

A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
