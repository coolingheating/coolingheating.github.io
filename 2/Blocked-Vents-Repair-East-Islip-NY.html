<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>There are many actions a property owner can take to choose products that will avoid indoor air problems from taking place - a couple of them are pointed out here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, consider using solid wood items. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
