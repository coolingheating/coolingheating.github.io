<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Florham Park NJ 07932</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
