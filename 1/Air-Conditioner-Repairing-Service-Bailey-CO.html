Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they must be positioned.

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost.
