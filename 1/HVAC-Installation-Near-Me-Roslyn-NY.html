<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
