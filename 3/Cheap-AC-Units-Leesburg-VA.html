<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.
