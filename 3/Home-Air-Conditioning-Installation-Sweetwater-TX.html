<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Sweetwater TX</h3>
<p>Call Miller's Cooling & Heating at (925) 447-3000 and constantly speak to a live and valuable  member of our group, who will immediately focus on your requirements.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
