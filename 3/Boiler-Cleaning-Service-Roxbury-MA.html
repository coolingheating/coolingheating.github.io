<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your home.

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold.
