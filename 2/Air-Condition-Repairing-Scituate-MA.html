<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Scituate MA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
