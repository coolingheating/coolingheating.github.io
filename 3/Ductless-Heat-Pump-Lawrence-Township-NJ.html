<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes.

If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
