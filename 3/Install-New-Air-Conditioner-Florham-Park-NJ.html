Not only was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
