<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can become obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can typically be carried out in just a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
