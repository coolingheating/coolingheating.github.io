<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>

There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
