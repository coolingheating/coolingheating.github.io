<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being caught in structures and concentrations build up inside, direct exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Crawfordsville IN</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
