<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
