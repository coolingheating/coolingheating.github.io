<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced.

Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system.
