Their techs are professional and very well-informed. Expenses are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. I did not bother to get rival's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was undoubtedly reasonable.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean the condenser coil.
