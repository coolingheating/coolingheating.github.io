<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
