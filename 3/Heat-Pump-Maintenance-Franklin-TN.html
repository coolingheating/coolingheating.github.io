<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
