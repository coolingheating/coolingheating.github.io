<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years back and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
