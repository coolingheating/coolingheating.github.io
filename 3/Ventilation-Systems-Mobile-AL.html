<p>The most common type of house heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey alternative, but more recent systems can be extremely energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems generally attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely effective natural gas furnaces can attain AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
