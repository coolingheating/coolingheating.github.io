Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly.

While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
