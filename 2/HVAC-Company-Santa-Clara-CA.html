<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been effectively dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
