<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was extremely extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn offered excellent customer care at the end of the consultation by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the market.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working, stability Energy was fast to react. They showed up the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heaters can heat the house. Truthfully, our home heater is made complex, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
