<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage.

Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue.
