<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
