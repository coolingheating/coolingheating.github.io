<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
