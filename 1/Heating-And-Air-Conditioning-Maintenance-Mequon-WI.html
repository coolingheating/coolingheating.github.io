<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Mequon WI</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor free gas that hinders the shipment of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a variety of signs from headaches, d izziness, weakness, disorientation, queasiness, and confusion, to tiredness in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest pain in individuals with chronic heart problem. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are often confused with the flu or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, infants, senior individuals, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing illness can be specifically conscious carbon monoxide exposures.<p>
