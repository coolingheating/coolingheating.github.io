<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
