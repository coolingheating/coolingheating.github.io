<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at Amherst MA</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
