<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
