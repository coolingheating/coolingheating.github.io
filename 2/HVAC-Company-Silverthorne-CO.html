<p>I have been using them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
