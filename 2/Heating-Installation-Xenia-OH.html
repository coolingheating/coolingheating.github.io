<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may notice moldy or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
