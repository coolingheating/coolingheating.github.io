<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house.
