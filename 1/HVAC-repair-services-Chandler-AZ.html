<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Chandler AZ Home Owners</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
