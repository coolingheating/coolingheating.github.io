<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Neenah WI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
