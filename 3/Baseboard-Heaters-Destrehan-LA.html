This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any concerns or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
