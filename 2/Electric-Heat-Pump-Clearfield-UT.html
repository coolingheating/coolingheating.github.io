<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heater, you may try to find a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and effectiveness.
