<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
