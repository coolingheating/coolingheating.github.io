<p>Specialist heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC experts recommend following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Picture 6).<p>
