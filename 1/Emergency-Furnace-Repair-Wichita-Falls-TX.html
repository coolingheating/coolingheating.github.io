<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were valuable and useful, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a much better offer, for extraordinary service. Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we could have more even heat.
