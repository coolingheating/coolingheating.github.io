No additional charge.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
