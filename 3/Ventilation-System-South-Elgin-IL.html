<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space a/c offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
