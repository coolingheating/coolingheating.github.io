<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
