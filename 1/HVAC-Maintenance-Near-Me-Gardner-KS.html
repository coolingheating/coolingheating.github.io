<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that collects throughout summertimes. The best thing to do is ensuring that the heater burners are checked and cleaned up completely prior to colder seasons begin.

<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being caught in structures and concentrations build up inside, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
