All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
