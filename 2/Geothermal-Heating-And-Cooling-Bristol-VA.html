<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance check outs annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and generally some other benefits. Some companies provide concern consultations to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
