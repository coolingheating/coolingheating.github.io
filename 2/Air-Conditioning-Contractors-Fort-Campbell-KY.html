<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
