<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are usually not very efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not attain an effectiveness higher than 90%. A few high-end brand names have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well because a drain needs to be installed.<p>
<p>If your furnace quits working, begin by calling RJ Heating. We often find that an easy repair or modification is all that's needed to help it run appropriately again. Much more often, our consumers are surprised that we are happy to repair a furnace rather of trying to sell them a brand-new one.
