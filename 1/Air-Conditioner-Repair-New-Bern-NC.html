<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the growth of mold in wet air. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health issue brought on by biological toxins include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and gastrointestinal issues.<p>
