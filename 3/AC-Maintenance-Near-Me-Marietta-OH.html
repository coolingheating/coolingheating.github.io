<p>A third method to choose whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can suggest your house may not have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
