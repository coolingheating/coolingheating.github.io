<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Bryant AR 72022</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
