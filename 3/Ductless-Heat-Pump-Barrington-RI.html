<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Barrington RI</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific proof has actually shown that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously contaminated than the outdoor air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research indicates that people spend around 90 percent of their time indoors. Hence, for lots of people, the risks to health may be greater due to exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
