<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>When deciding which of the finest AC systems they need to set up in their houses, there are a few main things that house owners will want to take into consideration. It truly depends upon what you value the most in a top brand central air conditioning conditioner. The major aspects for many homeowners will be the overall cost to install the very best air conditioner brands, lifespan of the AC system, guarantees used, energy performance (SEER ratings), and size of the unit you need for your house's square video (HEAPS) to efficiently cool your home.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
