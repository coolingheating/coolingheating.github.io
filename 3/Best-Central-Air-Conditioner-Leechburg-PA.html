To put it simply, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
