<p>We look at hints before we provide advice to change instead of repair a heating system. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
