<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may discover unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may pick to replace the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor unit if you do so. Nevertheless, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling styles, it may be better to change the entire system.<p>
