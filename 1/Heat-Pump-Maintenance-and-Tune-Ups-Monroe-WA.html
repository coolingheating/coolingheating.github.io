<p>Since an air conditioning unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When you purchase a new cooling and heating system, you're investing in your home, your household, and your organisation.
