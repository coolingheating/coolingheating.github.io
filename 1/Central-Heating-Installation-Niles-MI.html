The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house.

<p>Air ducts are accountable for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your house, supplying a comfy environment in every room. But ducts that are not set up correctly or maintained can disperse contaminants from one room to another.
