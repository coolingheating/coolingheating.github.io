<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
