People at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
