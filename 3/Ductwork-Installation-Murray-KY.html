During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.
