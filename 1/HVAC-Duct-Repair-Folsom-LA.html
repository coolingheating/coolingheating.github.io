<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE scores often include higher price. So, make certain to decide based on how typically you will utilize your heater, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For most temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter season, having an extremely high ranked heating unit is not always necessary.<p>
