<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Service in Bellevue Washington</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Glowing heating systems don't use ducts, which makes them quite a bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also do not produce cold and hot spots.

<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Bellevue WA</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
