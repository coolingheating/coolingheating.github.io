<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
