Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>
