An alternative to packaged systems is using different indoor and outside coils in split systems Split systems are chosen and extensively utilized around the world other than in The United States and Canada. In North America, divided systems are most often seen in residential applications, however they are gaining popularity in little commercial structures.

<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem.

Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
