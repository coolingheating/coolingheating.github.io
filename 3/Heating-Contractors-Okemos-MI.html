<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
