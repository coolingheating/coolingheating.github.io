<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of changing or exchanging air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
