"Humidifier fever" is a common disease triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Numerous fungi and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Both should be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
