<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
