AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
