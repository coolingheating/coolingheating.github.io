<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Connelly Springs NC 28612</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy.

The outside condenser system likewise changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
