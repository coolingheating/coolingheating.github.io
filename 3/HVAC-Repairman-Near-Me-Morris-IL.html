<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
