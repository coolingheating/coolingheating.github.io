Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newbies more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

The structure type consisted of both commercial and residential. Most of samples evaluated were checked positive for bacteria and fungis.<p>
