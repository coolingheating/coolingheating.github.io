<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
