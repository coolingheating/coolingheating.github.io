<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
