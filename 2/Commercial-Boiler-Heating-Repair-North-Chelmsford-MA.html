<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, differed, and common. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., workplace equipment; wall, floor and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health impacts pointed out. However, it is not necessarily real that the impacts kept in mind happen at the pollutant concentration levels usually found in the house.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
