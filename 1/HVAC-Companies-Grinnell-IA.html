<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might observe moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your medical professional about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
