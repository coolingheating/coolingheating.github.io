<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German technology". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, r-410a and r-134a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
