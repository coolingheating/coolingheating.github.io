Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, problem focusing, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some particular illness have actually been linked to specific air contaminants or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger instant signs but can result in cancer after many years.<p>

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
