<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency benefit. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
