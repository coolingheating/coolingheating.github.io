<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
