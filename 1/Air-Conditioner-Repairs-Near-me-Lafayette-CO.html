<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Lafayette CO</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
