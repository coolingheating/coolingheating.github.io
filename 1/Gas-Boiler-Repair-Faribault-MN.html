<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and effectiveness if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>No matter the kind of electric glowing floor heater, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or modified. Any interference or disruption in the circulation of electrical energy makes the system inoperable. This is among the disadvantages to setting up an electric radiant heat system. Nevertheless, assuming they are set up correctly and appropriately taken care of, the probability of them having issues is small.<p>
