<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a brand-new building.
