<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
