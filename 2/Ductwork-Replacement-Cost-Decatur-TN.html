Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the start. However then understood Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

To put it simply, in-floor heating unit offer a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfy we feel, the more likely we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>
