<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Steilacoom WA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house building and construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, roofs, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
