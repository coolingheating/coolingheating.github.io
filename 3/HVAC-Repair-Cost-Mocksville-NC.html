This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
