<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
