<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
