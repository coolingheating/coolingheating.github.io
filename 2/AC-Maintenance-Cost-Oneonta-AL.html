<h3>How to Limit the Costs of Air Conditioner Repair in Oneonta AL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank.

We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
