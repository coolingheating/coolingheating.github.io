<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
