Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
