<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
