HVAC experts recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
