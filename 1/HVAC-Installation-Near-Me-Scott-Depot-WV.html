Insulation might be a more effective solution to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors.
