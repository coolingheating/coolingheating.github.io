<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more efficient option to your cooling issues than replacing your devices.<p>

Central air conditioners should be expertly checked and changed before the beginning of every cooling season. Nevertheless, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly examination.
