<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the specialists thought they just didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
