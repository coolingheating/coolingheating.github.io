<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time.

I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
