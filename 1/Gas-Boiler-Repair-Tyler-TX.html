<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
