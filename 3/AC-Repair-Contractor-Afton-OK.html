<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Function in Afton OK</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing wise technology. Martin said the company can develop a dashboard within the building's controls that will offer data on its systems to permit real time presence, offering the ability to be preventative instead of reactionary. This service can be supplied to any commercial client, not simply throughout new building.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
