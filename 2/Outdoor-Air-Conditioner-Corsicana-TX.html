<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Corsicana TX</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run constantly is because something is dirty or blocked Prior to attempting to repair any problem, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is good to go, inspect the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, call a knowledgeable technician.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
