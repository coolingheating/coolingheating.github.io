The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many individuals.<p>
