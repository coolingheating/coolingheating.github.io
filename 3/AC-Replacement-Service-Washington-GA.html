<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and many other products.<p>

<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
