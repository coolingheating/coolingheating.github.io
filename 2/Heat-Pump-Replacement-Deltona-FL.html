<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
