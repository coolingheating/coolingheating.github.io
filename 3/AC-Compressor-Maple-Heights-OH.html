<p>Air contaminants can vary from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant resulting from gas that gets away into your home without being burnt.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
