<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
