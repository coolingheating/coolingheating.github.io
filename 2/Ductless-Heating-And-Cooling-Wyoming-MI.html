<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
