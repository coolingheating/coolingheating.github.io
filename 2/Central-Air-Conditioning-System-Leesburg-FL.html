<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
