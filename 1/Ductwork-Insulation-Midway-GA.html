<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others.

If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
