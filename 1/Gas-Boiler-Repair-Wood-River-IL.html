<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heaters have multiple control panel. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control board need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t correctly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
