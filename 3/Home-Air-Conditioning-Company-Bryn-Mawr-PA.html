<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Bryn Mawr PA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
