<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy effective approaches of heating or cooling a house. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be heated in cooler months by moving and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a few feet listed below ground. In the summer months, the procedure reverses, therefore cooling a house by eliminating heat.

<p>Since they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
