<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
