<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Glenwood Springs CO Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofing systems. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and assists tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
