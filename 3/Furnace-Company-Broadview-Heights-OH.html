Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
