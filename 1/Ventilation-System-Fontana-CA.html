<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power must not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, since the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
