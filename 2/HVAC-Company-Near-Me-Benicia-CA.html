Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
