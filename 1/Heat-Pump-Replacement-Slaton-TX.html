<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>There are many things to think about when trying to figure out how frequently I ought to replace my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a distinct DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how often your air conditioning filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right decision on how typically your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less typically you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one air conditioning filter need changing regularly.<p>
