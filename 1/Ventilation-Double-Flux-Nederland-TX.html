<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
