<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
