<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions.

When ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air may also be a problem.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
