<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
