<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, especially if you reside in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed regularly, your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you expect it to.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
