<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
