<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's probably your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
