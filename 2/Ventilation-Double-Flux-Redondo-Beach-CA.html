What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
