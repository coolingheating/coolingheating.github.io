<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
