<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
