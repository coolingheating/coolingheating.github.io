<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
