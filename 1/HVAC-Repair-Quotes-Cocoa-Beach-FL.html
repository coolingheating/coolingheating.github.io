<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more effective than room a/c. In addition, they run out the method, quiet, and hassle-free to operate.

In a typical air-conditioned home, air conditioning consumes more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy per year, triggering power plants to emit about 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
