<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house.

It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
