<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
