<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>To begin, it's an excellent idea to think of energy effectiveness. By picking a central AC unit that has as high of an efficiency ranking as possible, you can lower your carbon footprint and save cash in the long run. Performance ratings must be labeled with all systems. While effective units may cost more, opting for an Energy Star-rated home appliance is a fantastic way to enjoy additional assurance.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
