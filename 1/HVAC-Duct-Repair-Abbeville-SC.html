<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
