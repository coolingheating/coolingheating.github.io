<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a couple of years ago.<p>

<h3>Discontinue Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Lafayette IN</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
