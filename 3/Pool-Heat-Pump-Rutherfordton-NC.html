<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
