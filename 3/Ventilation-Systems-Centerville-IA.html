<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like an area heating unit) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
