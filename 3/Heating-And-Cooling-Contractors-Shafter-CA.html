<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
