<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the very same way as an automobile radiator or normal home air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
