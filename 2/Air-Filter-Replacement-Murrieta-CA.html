<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
