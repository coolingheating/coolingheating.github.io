<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one action mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repeated usage of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
