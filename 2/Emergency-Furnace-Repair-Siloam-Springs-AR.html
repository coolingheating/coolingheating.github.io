<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
