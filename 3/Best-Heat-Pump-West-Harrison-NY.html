<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>When discussing options for HVAC replacement, Bryant air conditioning brand name is another fantastic brand name that needs to be thought about.

Bryant ac system are frequently made with the same quality parts as a Provider brand HVAC system.

<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best choice for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
