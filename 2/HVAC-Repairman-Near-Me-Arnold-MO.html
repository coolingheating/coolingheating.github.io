<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Arnold MO</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are typically near the ceiling.
