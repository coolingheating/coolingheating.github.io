<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit conveniently into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.
