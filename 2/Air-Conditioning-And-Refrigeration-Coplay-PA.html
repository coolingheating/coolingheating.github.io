<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure fact that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will often develop in ductwork, restricting air flow. Given that ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem very daunting at first, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and knowledge. When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't have to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
