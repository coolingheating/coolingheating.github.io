<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big commercial and office complex such as medical facilities and skyscrapers, automobiles such as cars, trains, planes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with regard to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally greater than lots of heatpump options, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the model you purchase.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
