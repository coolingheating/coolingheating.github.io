<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>5. Smell great naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney aroma with a tidy kitchen or clean artificial scents in laundry items and air fresheners discharge lots of different chemicals into the air.
