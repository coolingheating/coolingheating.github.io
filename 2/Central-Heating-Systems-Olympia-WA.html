<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
