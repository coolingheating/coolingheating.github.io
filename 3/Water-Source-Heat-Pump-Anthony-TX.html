<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
