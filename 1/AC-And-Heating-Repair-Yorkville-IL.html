<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
