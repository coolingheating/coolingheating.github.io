<p>The primary health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
