<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in performance benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

All the moist hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining appropriately, you'll have a water leak. A restriction in your drain pipelines causes a water leakage. There are many different places an obstruction can happen. Among the primary locations where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
