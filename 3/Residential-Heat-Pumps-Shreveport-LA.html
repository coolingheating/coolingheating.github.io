<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Shreveport LA</h3>
<p>The majority of people understand that outside air contamination can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can likewise have considerable, harmful effect. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air toxins indicate that indoor levels of toxins may be two to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination among the top five environmental health threats to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
