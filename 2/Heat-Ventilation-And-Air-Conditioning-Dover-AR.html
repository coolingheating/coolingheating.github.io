<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working.

<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Dover AR</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing Waychoff for about ten years. First, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have preserved my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and very well-informed. Expenses are affordable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was undoubtedly sensible.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
