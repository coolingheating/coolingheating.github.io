<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
