<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Floral Park NY</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely happy that someone as skilled as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c before you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to check AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>

And, as various public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenses.<p>
