<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
