<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
