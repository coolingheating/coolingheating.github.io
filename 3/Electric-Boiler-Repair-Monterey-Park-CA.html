<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
