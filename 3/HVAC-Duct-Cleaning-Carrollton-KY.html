<p>Many people are aware that outside air pollution can impact their health, but indoor air pollution can also have considerable, damaging impact. EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to 5 times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air pollution among the top five environmental health dangers to the public.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
