<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
