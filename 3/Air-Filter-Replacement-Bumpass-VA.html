<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or glowing floor heating or can be set up in a brand-new building. Required air systems will need a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heating systems will require water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop required depends on the cooling and heating requirements for your house and is critical iin making sure the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is measured in loads. Usually, a 3-ton setup needs to suffice for the average home, but home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all factors which will affect the right size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you appropriately size a system.<p>
