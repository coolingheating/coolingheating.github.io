<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings construct up inside your home.<p>

<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and cure-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time repairing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
