<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
