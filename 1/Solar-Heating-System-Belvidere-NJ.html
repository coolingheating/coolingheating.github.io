<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
