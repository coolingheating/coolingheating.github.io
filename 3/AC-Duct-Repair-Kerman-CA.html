Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the floor or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people.

Took care of a part that was not covered under warranty quickly and effective and did not have to pay a leg and an arm to get it done.
