<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
