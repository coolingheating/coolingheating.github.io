<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been running issue free for the past 2+ years.
