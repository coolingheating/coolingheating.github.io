<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from items or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.)

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking information from the employer.

Review of this information may recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
