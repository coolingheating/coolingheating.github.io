<p>For whole house installations, it's tough, if almost difficult, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing house, especially a hydronic system. Localized glowing flooring heat systems to be utilized in one or several spaces like restrooms, kitchens or utility room are easily renovated with electric radiant flooring heat.

<p>Some sources, such as constructing products, home furnishings, and home items like air fresheners, release toxins more or less continuously. Other sources, related to activities performed in the home, release contaminants intermittently. These include smoking cigarettes, using unvented or malfunction-ing ranges, furnaces, or area heaters, using solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, using paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and using cleaning items and pesticides in house cleaning. High pollutant concentrations can stay in the air for extended periods after some of these activities.<p>
