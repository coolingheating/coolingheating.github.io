<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractor in Monroe</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A/c producers usually make rugged, high quality items. Begin by examining any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it might flatter twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a few years earlier.<p>

<p>Central air systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>You need to always hire an expert to perform AC repair, for the exact same factor that you rely on an expert plumber or electrician.
