Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
