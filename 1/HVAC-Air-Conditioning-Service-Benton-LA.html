<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
