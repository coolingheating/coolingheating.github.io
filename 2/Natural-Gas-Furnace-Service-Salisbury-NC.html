They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
