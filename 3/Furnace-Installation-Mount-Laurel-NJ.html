<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health impacts mentioned.

<p>The primary factor house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services offered.

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
