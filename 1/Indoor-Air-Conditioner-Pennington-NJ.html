<p>Next, and perhaps just as essential when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air.

Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
