This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue.
