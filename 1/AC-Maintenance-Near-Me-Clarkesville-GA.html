<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw.
