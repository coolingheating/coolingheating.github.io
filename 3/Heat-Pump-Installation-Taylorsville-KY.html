What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months before the present one expired. She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
