<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Bloomfield New Mexico</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
