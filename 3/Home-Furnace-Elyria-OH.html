<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The company began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, up until the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under a number of owners. Goodrich's father was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to purchase what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
