<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
