<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are offered to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Service! Environment Pro is dependable and really appreciated us and our situation. We got back one night to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could search for and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated home again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right prior to a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
