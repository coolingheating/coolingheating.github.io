And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions.
