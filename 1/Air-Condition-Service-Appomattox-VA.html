<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heat pump need to be devoid of all blockages and debris. Blockages can obstruct the circulation of condensed water and trigger moisture accumulation within the system. Excess moisture can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, uneven temperature regulation, bacteria, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to make sure all excess wetness flows away from the system.<p>
