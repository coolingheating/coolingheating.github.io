<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on regularly might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly.

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Urbana OH</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

According to the marketplace research study company Statista, household penetration in the U.S. wise house market is currently at 33 percent and is expected to reach 54 percent by 2023.
