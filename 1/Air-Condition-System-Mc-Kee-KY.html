<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation.
