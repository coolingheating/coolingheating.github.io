<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than commercial or outdoor settings.

<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Want to Know in Tulsa OK</h3>
<p>Biological contaminants: the biological pollutants can include germs, viruses, fungis (mold), allergen allergen, animal dander, insect bio detritus, fiberglass and fibers, pollen, cockroach irritant, and so on. and may result from inadequate maintenance and house cleaning, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or might be brought into the structure by occupants, infiltration, or ventilation air. Allergic responses to indoor biological contaminant exposures cause signs in allergic individuals and also play a key role in triggering asthma episodes for an approximated 15 million Americans.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
