<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heating systems that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
