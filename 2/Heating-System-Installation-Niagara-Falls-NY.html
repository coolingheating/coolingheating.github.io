<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
