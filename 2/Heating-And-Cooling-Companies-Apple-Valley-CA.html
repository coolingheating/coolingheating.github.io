An oversize compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
