Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure.

<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for house owners to consider. Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best choice for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
