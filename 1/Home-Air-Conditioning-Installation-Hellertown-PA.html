And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
