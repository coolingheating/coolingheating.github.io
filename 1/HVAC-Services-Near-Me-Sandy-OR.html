<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Sandy OR Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last floor surface. This is generally used in a second or third-floor  location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
