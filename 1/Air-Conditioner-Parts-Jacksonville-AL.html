<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
