<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in which abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
