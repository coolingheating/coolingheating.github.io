Also, some specific illness have been linked to particular air contaminants or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate signs but can lead to cancer after many years.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limitations use dose-response information which show the health impacts of repetitive exposure to one particular chemical. Comparable information is not offered for long-term, low-level exposures to a mix of pollutants as holds true for IAQ problems. Currently, there is insufficient information offered to forecast the impacts of exposure to several possibly damaging agents at the very same time.<p>
