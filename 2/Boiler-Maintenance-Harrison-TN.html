<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early deterioration, causing cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  an extremely useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
