<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be effectively determined or fixed without a detailed building examination. These examinations might start with written surveys and telephone assessments in which building private investigators evaluate the history of occupant symptoms and building operation procedures. Sometimes, these questions may quickly reveal the problem and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
<p>Typically the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
