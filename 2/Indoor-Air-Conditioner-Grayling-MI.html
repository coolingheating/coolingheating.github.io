<h3>Central Heating Installation in Grayling MI 49738</h3>
<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in terms of environmental costs. Due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is extracted directly from the ground, it protects the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or contaminants. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in fridges. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical energy, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating unit that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
