<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
