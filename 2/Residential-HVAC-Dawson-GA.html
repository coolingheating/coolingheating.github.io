<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less frequent (however typically more serious) cases of people ending up being ill after remaining in a particular building at a specific time.

Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI triggered by germs which can infect a structure's a/c system.<p>

<h3>Furnace Installation in Dawson Georgia</h3>
<p>Move the thermostat setting to heat." A furnace can be daunting-- particularly when the heat will not turn on. Nevertheless, there is good news from furnace repair pros. Approximately a quarter of all service calls could be avoided with simple furnace fixes that cost little or absolutely nothing. In this article, we'll focus on the typical furnace troubleshooting culprits and show you what to do about furnace issues.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize excessive energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too little, then your home won't be warmed sufficiently and the system will have to continuously run to attempt to heat the whole house, which will increase heating bills.<p>
<p>As with the majority of house improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heater can vary widely based upon the size of the home. Most furnaces will last between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
