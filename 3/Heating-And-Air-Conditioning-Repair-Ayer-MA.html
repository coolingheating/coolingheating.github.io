<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Ayer MA</h3>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
