A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is frequently recommended rather.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your system if it's five years of ages or older. The very best central air conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while delivering the very same quantity of cooling.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
