Indoor air pollution studies have determined several pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these contaminants are very important in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
