<p>I have been using them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
