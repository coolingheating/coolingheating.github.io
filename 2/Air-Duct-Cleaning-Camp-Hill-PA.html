With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly choice, but more recent systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems typically achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely efficient gas heating systems can achieve AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
