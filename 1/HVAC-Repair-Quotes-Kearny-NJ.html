<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and last floor finish. This is typically utilized in a second or third-floor  location and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
