<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Specialists suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are more appropriate for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually found the trouble area in examining the costs. He dealt with the problem in one day, had adjusted the expense to what I considered reasonable before he recalled, understood what may have caused the issue and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not happen again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs entirely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
