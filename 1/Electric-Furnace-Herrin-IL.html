<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, visit Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
