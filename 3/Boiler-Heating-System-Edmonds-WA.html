<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Edmonds WA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>There are several variables that contribute to indoor air contamination. Such factors include using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas produced by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
