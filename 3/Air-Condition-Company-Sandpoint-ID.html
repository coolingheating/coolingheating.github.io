The average summer season temperature to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to reach the correct SEER score for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling systems produced in the United States.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
