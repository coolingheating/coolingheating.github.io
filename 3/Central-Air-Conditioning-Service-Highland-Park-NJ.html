<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
