<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to consider. Often times, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best choice for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
