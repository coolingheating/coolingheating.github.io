<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He was friendly, simple and a completely satisfying person to have around that entire time. His time and knowledge to RESOLVE the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather uncertain diagnostic.<p>
<p>Location the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank.

<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out.

I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Hiring Fort Hood TX HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

They will have the ability to properly assess the condition of the furnace and make any suggestions.<p>
