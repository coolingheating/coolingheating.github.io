<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in performance benefit. Due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
