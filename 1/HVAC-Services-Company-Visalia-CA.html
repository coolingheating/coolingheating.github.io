<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>. Before picking the installation area of a/c, numerous main elements need to be considered. Firstly, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor systems need to not fall on the location of rest or workspace.

The outdoor system must likewise be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently released outside and the efficiency of the whole system will drop sharply. It is highly a good idea to set up the ac system systems in quickly available locations, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
