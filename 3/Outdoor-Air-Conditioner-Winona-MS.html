<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>

That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
