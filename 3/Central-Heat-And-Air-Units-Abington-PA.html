<p>Remember that the SEER rating is computed utilizing the same set of temperatures throughout the board. The average summertime temperature level to get to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to get to the proper SEER ranking for your location, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling systems manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>My eldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, human beings breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not poisonous, however may end up being dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to collect. Germs or micro-organisms might also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the whole workplace or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
