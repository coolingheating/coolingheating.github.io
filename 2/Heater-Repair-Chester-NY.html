Due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground, it safeguards the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or toxins.

While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they release far less greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating unit that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor.
