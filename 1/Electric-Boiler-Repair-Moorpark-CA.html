<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
