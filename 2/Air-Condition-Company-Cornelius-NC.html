Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar.

<p>The first ac system and fridges utilized flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
