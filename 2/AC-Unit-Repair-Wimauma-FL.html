<h3>Passive Ventilation in Wimauma Florida</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Many people don't recognize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break with time. That can jeopardize the efficiency of the system and eventually harm it enough that you need to purchase furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will thoroughly analyze the connections and evaluate the performance of the system. They'll search for frayed and damaged wires and replace them in order to minimize the risk of fire and part failure.<p>
<p>Prior to cooling or installing any new heating system in a house, it is needed to re minimize the energy and assess load of the house.

<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice.

My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
