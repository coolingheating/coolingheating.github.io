<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources may not posture a significant health threat on their own, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a major threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that many people can take both to lower the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can reduce the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends upon individual sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
