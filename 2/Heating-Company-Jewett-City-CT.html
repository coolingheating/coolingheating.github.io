<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
