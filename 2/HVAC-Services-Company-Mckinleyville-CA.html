Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment and huge residences.

A steam boiler replacement expenses between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
