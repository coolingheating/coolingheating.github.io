<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
