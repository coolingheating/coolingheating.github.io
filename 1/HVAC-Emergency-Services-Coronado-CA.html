<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. If your air conditioning system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, just adding refrigerant is not a service. A qualified technician should repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and performance of your a/c unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>

R-600 (isobutane) is already extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>
