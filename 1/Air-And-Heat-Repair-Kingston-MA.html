<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person must be required almost any maintenance aside from routine cleaning.
