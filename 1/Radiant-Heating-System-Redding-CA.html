<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building products, smoking cigarettes, family products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in produced items.
