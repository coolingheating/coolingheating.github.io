<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
