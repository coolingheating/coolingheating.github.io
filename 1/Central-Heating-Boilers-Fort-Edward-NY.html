<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level.
