<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they need to be positioned. The majority of typically they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people primarily stay seated in that specific location.

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are normally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
