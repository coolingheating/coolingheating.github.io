Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT a good idea. You won't conserve any money and will end up triggering more issues for your heating unit.<p>

Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
