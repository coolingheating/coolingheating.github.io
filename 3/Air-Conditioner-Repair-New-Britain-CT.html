The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step.

<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
