<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal business. A thoroughly crafted company plan for an HVAC company is the primary step to handle those peaks and lulls so your earnings stay healthy year-round.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
