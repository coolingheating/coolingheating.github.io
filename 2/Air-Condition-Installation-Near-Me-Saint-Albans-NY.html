<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
