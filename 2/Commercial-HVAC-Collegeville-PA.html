<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
