<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
