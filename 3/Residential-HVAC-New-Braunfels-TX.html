<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides heat from the floor up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are utilized to seeing this type in the yards of homes.
