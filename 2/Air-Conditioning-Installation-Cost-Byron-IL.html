What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options.

We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
