<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
