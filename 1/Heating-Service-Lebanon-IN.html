<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE rankings typically feature greater price tags. So, make sure to decide based upon how typically you will use your heating system, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year.

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future.

<p>Utilize or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical approach of decreasing exposure to indoor air contaminants, likewise will decrease however not remove exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.
