<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no contaminant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions.

<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Newalla OK 74857</h3>

<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the tools or skills necessary to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
<p>The primary factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services provided. If the system is brand-new and still under a producer's guarantee, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any significant repairs must be covered under the maker's warranty. Nevertheless, some manufacturers need routine maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
