<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is actually warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
