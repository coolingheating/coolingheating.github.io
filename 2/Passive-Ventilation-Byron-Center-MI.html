<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
