<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are offered to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Excellent Client Service!

Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely thankful to have a heated house once again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to help us right prior to a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
