<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered excellent client service at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
