<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
