<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may notice unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can often be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent need to ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out.
