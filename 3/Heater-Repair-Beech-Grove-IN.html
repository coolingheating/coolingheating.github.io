<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no impurity sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as an automobile radiator or common home air conditioning system does.
