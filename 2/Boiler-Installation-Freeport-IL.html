<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>
<p>If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your pastime involves lead, you might unwittingly bring lead into your house on your clothes or hands. You might also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil very near houses may be polluted from lead paint on the outside of the building. Soil by roads and highways may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet prior to entering the house. If you work with lead in your job or a hobby, change your clothes before you go house and clean these clothes individually. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy locations rather of dirt which sticks to toys and fingers. Try to keep your children from consuming dirt, and ensure they wash their hands when they come within.<p>

<p>This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself offered - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is competent with these gadgets).
