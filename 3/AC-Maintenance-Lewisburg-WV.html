<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
