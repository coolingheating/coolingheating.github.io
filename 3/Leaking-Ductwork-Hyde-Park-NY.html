<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
