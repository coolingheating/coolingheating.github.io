<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's probably your problem.
