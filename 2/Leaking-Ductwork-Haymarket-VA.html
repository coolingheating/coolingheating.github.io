<p>My oldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was six months before the existing one ended. She didn't require a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
