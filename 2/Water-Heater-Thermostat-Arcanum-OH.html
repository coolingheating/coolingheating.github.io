<p>Consider an entire home dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old sufficient to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can take pleasure in some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
