<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized different approaches. The CMHC study contacted numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they became part of a research study, and the scientists did not control for time spent or methods used. The EPA research study prescribed and controlled approaches used on a smaller number of homes.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
