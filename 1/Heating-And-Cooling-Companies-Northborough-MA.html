<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Northborough MA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
