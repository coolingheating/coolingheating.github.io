<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather.

The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold development and wetness indoors is associated with a higher frequency of occupant breathing problems.<p>
