<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace makers, cleaning products, construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outdoor pollutants. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
