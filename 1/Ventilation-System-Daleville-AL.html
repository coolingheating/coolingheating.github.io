<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they simply didn't appear best and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
