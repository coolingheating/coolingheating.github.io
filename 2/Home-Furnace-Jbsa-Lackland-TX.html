<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year.

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
