<p>The exhaust outlets permit all hazardous gases to escape your residential or commercial property so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can lead to a hazardous build-up and compromise your security.

<p>When you invest in a new cooling and heating system, you're purchasing your home, your family, and your service.

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating unit, you may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters.

The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
