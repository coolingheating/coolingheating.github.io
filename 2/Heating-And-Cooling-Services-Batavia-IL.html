<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
