<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
