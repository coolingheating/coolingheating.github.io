<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
