<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly appear higher than regular, it is probably time to think about a brand-new system. New heating equipment is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel costs right away, not to discuss the money you'll minimize repair expenses. You can probably expect to cut your fuel expenses in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>A/c unit makers usually make rugged, high quality products. If your air conditioner fails, begin by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers.
