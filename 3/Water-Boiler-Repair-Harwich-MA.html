The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils.

It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
