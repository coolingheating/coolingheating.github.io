<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have two significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work.
