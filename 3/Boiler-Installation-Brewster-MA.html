<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
