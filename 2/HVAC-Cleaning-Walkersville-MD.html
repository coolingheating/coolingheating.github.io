<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, since it is secured inside. When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to install.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
