<h3>How to Maintain Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Spring Valley CA</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological contaminants are damp or damp structure products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Numerous fungis and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
