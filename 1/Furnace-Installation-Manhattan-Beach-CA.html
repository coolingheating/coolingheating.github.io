<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
