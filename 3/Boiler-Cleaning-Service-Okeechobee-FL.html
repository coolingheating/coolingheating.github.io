<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control board should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
