<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, schools and homes matters, especially given that we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely humid climates or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated performance benefit. Ductless heatpump are fantastic for additions since they do not need any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>In most cases, if products have stopped working to dry out several days after the believed water occasion, mold growth is believed within wall cavities even if it is not instantly noticeable. Through a mold investigation, which may consist of destructive evaluation, one need to be able to determine the presence or lack of mold. In a scenario where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been jeopardized, mold remediation may be needed. Mold screening and inspections need to be performed by an independent investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to insure precise outcomes; totally free mold testing offered by remediation companies is not advised.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most economical if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or skills required to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
