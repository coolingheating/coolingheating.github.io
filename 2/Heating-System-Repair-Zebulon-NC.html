<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
