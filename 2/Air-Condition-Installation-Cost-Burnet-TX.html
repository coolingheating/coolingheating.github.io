Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
