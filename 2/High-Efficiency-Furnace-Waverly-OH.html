<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
