<p>I have been utilizing Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have actually preserved my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and very experienced. Expenses are affordable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
