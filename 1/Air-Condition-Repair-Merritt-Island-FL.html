The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system.

Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not basic, given that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
