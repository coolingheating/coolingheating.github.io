"Humidifier fever" is a common illness triggered by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs.

Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and family plants.<p>
<p>Lots of elements affect IAQ. These elements include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), issues managing temperature, high or low humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering into the structure. Often, particular contaminants like dust from building or renovation, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including percentages of chemicals released as a gas with time) may trigger bad IAQ.<p>
