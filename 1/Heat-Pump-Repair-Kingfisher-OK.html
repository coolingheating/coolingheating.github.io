<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house.

Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

Direct exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being caught in concentrations and buildings build up indoors.<p>

Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
