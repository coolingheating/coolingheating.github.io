<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>

<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they detected the concern and repaired really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
