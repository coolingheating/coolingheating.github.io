<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards generally amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial cost of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new building and construction (houses generally use in between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>
