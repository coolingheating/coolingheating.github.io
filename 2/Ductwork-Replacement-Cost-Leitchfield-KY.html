<p>Since the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more efficient. This was initially driven by rising energy expenses, and has actually more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues. Furthermore, improvements to the HVAC system effectiveness can also assist increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the United States, the EPA has actually imposed tighter restrictions over the years. There are several methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can manage, a lot of Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a harsh, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping track of data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information might identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping track of data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
