<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a basic air conditioning unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air course.

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
