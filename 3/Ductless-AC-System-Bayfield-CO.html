<p>Iâ $ m actually picky with my things. I like my devices and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs. So buying this a/c to replace my old one was somewhat of a difficult reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am happy I got this though because it has actually restored my faith in great manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Carrier I got because I purchased it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
