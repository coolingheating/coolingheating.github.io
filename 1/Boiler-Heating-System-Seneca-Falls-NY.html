My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12.

This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
