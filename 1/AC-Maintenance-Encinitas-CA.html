<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost.
