<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, until the mandate for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production.

Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to purchase what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>
