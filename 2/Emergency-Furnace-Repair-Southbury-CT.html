<p>There are numerous sources of indoor air contamination in any house. These consist of combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, tobacco, coal, and wood items; structure materials and furnishings as diverse as scrubby, asbestos-containing insulation, damp or damp carpet, and cabinetry or furniture made from specific pushed wood products; items for household cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling systems and humidification devices; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outdoor air pollution.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in building are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move airborne contaminants from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any offered opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>The most harmful asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can stay and accumulate in the lungs.
