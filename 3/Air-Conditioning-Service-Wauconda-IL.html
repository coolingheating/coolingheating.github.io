<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and constructing security at reasonable energy costs. Load determining is described as the Handbook J estimation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video footage alone.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
