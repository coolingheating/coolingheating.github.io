<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure materials, cigarette smoking, home items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in produced products. For example, it is utilized to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as an element of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and covering products.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators used flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
