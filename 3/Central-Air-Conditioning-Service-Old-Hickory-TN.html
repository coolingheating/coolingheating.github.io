<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
