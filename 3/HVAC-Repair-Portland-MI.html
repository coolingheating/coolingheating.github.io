<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Portland MI</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic task clause" uses. This stipulation, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, states that a company needs to supply a safe and healthy  office. Therefore, making sure the air is of excellent quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
