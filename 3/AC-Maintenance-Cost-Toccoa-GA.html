<h3>Air Condition Installation Cost in Toccoa GA 30577</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
