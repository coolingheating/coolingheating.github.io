As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
