<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
