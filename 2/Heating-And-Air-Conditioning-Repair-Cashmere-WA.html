<p>Immediate effects may show up after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are usually short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up not long after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more affordable method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Often a temporary indoor air quality problem is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location.

However more complicated issues-- recognized by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the 3 tactics below might be suitable.<p>
