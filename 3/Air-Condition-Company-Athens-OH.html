Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
