<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
