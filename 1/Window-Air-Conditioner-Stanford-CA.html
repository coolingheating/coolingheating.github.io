<p>Sean was really practical. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, decreasing their efficiency in time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
