<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
