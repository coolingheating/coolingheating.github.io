<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>The EPA advises that you have your air ducts inspected by a professional heating and cooling contractor.
