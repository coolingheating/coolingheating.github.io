He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
