<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is wintry, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Also, if the air conditioner smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your house. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing. Your heating technician can install controls which instantly shut down the heat pump if temperatures reach and drop below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
