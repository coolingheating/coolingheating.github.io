<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
