<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at threat.

EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year.

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating unit seems less like a high-end product and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated up floorings were good enough for the Roman Empire) But before you commit to what can be a significant renovation task, it's finest to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heating system is an appropriate service for your particular home heating requirements.<p>
