<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced reasonably, have actually handled the one repair I needed well, and are expert and constantly on-time. Have been through a few companies over the years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I've had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been fantastic.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future.
