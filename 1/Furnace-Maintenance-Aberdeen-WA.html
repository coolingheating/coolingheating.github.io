<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
