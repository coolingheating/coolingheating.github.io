<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
