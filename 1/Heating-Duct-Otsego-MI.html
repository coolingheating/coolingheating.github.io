<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in collecting details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
