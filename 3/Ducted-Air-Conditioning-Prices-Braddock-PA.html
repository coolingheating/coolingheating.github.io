Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might look for and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely thankful to have a heated home once again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>

Would advise them anytime.<p>
