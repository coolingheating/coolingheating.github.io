<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
