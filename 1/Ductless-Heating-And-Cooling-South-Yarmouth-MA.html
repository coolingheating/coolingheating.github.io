<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in South Yarmouth MA</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>

<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
