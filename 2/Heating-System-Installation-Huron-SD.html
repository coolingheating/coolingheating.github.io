Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure.
