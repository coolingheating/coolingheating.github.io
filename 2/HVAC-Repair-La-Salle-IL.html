<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning system?

If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities exist will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
