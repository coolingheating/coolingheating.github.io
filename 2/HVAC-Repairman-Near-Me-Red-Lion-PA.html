<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
