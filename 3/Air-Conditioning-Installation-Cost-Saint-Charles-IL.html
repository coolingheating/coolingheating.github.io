<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly treat and harden-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
