If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Phoenixville PA 19460</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has determined building materials, home furnishings, and mold as severe issues, but much of the threat also originates from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant resulting from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older houses might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
