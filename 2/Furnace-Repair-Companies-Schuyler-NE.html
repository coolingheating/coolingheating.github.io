<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
