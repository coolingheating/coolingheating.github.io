Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but many use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better option.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to change the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system.
