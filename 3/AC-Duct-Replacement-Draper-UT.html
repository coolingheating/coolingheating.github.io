<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
