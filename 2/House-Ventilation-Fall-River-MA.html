<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in Fall River MA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
