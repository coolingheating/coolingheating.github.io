<p>Details supplied in this safety guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Structures continuously develop as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them in addition to the occupants, products, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly interacting, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For instance, we may see a window as changing somewhat over time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be evolving as an outcome of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>

And if it's too small, you won't get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>
<p>HVAC coils typically provide you a good 15-20 years of life before they start developing refrigerant leakages. Refrigerant leakages aren't the only problem a/c coils have.
