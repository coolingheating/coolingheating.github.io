<p>A geothermal heating system does not create its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as coal, gas, or oil. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth. Additionally, a geothermal heating and cooling system uses significantly less electrical energy compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heater an attractive option to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a favorable impact on the environment.<p>
<p>Numerous HVAC service technicians frequently find themselves operating in uncomfortable and cramped areas, at extreme heights, and sometimes in hazardous conditions like extreme weather (to service outdoor heat pumps and heat exchangers).

<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Homestead FL</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
