<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, however to have two major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
