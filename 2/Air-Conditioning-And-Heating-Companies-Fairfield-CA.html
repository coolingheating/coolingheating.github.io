<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Understand in Fairfield CA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.
