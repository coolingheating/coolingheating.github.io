<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
