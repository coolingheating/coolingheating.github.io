<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling.

In addition, residents should look out to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization steps should not be undertaken until these problems have been remedied.<p>
<p>Intensifying the noted health signs may be job stress. In part, due to different elements of office automation, the most stressful aspects of office work are increasing.

<p>PE firms tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some point.

<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study discovered.

And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
