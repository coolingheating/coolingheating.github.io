<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>While toxins typically found in indoor air are responsible for numerous hazardous effects, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are needed to produce particular health issue. People also react very in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air pollutants. More research is required to much better understand which health impacts occur after exposure to the typical contaminant concentrations discovered in houses and which take place from the greater concentrations that happen for brief time periods.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
