As a society, we make certain that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't believe adequate about direct exposure to all the important things we put in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right away, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
