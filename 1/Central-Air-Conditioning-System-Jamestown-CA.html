<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
