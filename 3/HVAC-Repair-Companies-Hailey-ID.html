<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Make certain all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
