<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside.

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
