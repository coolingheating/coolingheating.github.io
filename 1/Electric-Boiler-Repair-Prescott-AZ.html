<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for several years.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
