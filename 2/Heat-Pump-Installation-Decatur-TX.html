<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants given off by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside might cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the whole surface area of a flooring heats the lower half of the space, enveloping residents in warmth at a lower total temperature-- in many cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit."

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it.

The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
