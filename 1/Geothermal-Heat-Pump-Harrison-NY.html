<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's hard to discover a sincere AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
