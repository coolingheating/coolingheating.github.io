<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room cooling offers maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
