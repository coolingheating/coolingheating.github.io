<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Silver Spring MD</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
