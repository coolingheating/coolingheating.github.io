<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
