<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>If you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house, plan on investing a number of thousand dollars for the complete system.
