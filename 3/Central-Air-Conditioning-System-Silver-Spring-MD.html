<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
