<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
