<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
