<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
