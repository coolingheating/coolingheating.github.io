<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in effectiveness advantage. Because they don't need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
