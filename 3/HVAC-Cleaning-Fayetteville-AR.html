<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and solidify-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
