<p>Though it may be difficult to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your home, however there are numerous other toxins that can not just dirty up the air, however result in other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural substances) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to supply adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
