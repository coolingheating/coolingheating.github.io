<p>Specific immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently tough to figure out if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is very important to take note of the time and location the symptoms happen. If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>Numerous indoor air contaminants originate from the kitchen. Gas stoves release hazardous pollutants, including carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide. Even electric burners produce those very same pollutants in lower levels, along with other particles that can be quickly taken in into your bloodstream. So, when you're cooking, make sure to switch on your kitchen vents, or open a window to help filter out the air even more.<p>

Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants also.<p>
