<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, infants, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
