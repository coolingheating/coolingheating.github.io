Too large and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too little and your ac system won't have the ability to cool your house correctly. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the elements that you require to take into account.

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
