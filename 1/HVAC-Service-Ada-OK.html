<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping device to circulate hot water that warmed their stone floors.

Incorrectly located outdoor air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
