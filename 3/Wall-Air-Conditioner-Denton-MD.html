<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stagnant air might also be a problem when ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of workers in the area.<p>
<p>As with houses, the most essential element affecting indoor air quality is the presence of contaminant sources. Commonly discovered office pollutants and their sources. consist of ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building materials; formaldehyde from pushed wood products; other organics from developing products, carpet, and other workplace furnishings, cleaning materials and activities, washroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and printing shop; biological pollutants from dirty ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>

<p>There's a big difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common form of home heating-- convection.

<p>While pollutant levels from individual sources might not position a significant health threat by themselves, many houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to take actions that can lower the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a range of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually identified building products, furnishings, and mold as major concerns, however much of the threat also originates from burning things.

<p>The most underrated HVAC element in your air conditioning system is the evaporator & condenser coil. When making a big HVAC decision on replacing your equipment, most people think the compressor is the only part that matters.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
