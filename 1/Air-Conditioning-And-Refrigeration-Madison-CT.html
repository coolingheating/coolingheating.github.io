<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at reasonable energy expenses. Load determining is referred to as the Manual J estimation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone. As with determining the size of a system required based upon BTUs, identifying the correct size of unit for your home likewise depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
