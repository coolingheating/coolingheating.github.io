<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we recommend utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by serving as a really effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes.
