The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
