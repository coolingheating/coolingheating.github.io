<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
