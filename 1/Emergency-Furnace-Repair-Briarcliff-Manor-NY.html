<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and homes matters, especially given that we invest most of our lives indoors. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, as well as all other types of heat pumps, have performances ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a scientific method of figuring out just how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. Many geothermal heat pump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for every single unit of energy used to power the system, three to five units are provided as heat.<p>
