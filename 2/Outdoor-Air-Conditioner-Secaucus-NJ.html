<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Think about potential impacts of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the producer's directions, especially directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heater remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
