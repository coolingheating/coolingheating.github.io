<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having fixed the issue with a simple repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part.

His time and knowledge to FIX the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a mild climate, where the temperature level doesn't get too low or too high. To put it simply, they are perfect for our Seattle environment! They are highly effective, beating out most other kinds of heating systems in efficiency.
