<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace because it's the most common heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
