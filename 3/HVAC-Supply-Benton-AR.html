Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family house installation service entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
