The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future.

They arrive at each and every task dressed professionally in uniform and on time, reducing intrusion into your house with efficient action, foot protectors, floor coverings, and the most innovative tools for the job.

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
