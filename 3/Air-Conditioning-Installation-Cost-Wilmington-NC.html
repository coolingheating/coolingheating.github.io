<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the growth of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
