<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
