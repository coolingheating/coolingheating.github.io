<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable resource area recommends that "Air Purification must have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While room cooling provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
