<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important impacts. In other cases, whether a person responds to a toxin depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>

<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
