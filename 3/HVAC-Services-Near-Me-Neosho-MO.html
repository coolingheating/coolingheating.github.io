Incorrectly situated outdoor air intake vents can likewise generate air polluted with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms.

Also, if the ac system smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your house.
