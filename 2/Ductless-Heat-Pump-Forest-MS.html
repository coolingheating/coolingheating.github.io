<p>Instant discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Support! Environment Pro is trustworthy and truly appreciated us and our situation. We got home one night to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might search for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house once again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to assist us right before a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my friends.<p>
