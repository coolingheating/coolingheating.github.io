<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

It wasn't up until later on, as they continued working with us, that they discovered and executed indoor air quality keeping an eye on to provide a much healthier, more secure building environment-- and to head off the negative effects associated with indoor air toxins.<p>

Do not position the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will lower the unit's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
