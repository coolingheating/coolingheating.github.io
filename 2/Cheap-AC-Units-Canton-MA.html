<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make certain all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
