<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter season can exacerbate problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is very important to be familiar with a few of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that might be hiding in your environments.<p>
<p>If your single stage ac system isn't old sufficient to justify replacement, consider a whole house dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing greater convenience at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
