<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Furnaces are like cars. As they age, you can replace one part just require another part changed or fixed next year. It doesn't take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below absolutely no night.<p>
<p>We're spending a lot more time inside your home, these days. While many people presume contamination is simply an outside issue, your house (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we don't think adequate about direct exposure to all the things we put in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- immediately, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
