<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
