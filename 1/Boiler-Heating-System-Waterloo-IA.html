<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively solidify and cure-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
