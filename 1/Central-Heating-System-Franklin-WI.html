<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Franklin WI Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
