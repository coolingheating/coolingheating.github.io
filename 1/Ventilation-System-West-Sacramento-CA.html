Load determining is referred to as the Manual J computation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone. As with determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of unit for your home likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>Over the previous couple of years, there has actually been some promotion recommending that houseplants have been revealed to minimize levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is presently no evidence, however, that a reasonable variety of houseplants eliminate significant amounts of toxins in offices and homes. Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered due to the fact that overly moist soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic people.<p>
