<p>My eldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
