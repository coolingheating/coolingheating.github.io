<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Barberton OH Home Owners</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system.

<h3>Install Air Conditioner in Barberton OH 44203</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
