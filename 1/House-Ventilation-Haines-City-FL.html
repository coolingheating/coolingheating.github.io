<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
