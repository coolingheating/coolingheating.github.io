<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
