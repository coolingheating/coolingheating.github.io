<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer ought to check measurements of air, humidity and temperature circulation. In addition, assessment and testing of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to ensure it is working according to specs for constructing use and tenancy) should be performed. A structure walk-through to look for odors and look for water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings may be useful. Leaks need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofings and in boiler pans can become contaminated with bacteria or fungi and require to be removed, likewise. In some scenarios, particular screening for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a car radiator or common home a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
