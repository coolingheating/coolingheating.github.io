<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He was friendly, uncomplicated and a completely enjoyable person to have around that entire time. His time and proficiency to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>With the cost of electricity and gas increasing, it is necessary to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy savings. This will keep you from unnecessarily paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & House Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Inspection of your furnace consists of a Performance Check-Up, in which the thermostat is looked for precision and the burners are changed for optimal effectiveness. Paragon Heating & House Comfort Solutions DOES NOT utilize the useless 'eyeball the flame' approach that other companies use. Rather, the combustion is enhanced by determining the exhaust gasses and making clinical adjustments. This alone could spend for the whole maintenance see at today's price of gas.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that resistance varies significantly from individual to private, it is not useful to design a universal standard fit for all in terms of exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services carried out a 10 year research study evaluating more than 7,000 structures and over 25,000 ecological samples that were gathered throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type consisted of both commercial and residential. Most of samples examined were tested positive for fungi and germs.<p>
