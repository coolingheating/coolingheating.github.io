<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
