The vast majority of these systems are multi-family or mixed-use, where cooling is more of a market standard, states Scott Vollmoeller of engineering company Glumac.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer must inspect measurements of humidity, air and temperature level flow. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make sure it is working according to specs for constructing usage and tenancy) ought to be carried out. A structure walk-through to look for odors and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings might be useful. Leaks need to be eliminated.

There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
