<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>It is especially important to take as a number of these actions as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can create high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or taking part in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might also choose to do a few of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather condition permits.<p>
