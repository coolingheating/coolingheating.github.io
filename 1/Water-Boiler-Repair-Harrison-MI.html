<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
