<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
