<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work.
