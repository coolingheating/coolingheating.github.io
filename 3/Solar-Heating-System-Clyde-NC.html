Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Inspection of your furnace consists of a Performance Check-Up, in which the thermostat is checked for precision and the burners are changed for maximum performance. Paragon Heating & House Comfort Solutions DOES NOT utilize the worthless 'eyeball the flame' technique that other companies utilize. Rather, the combustion is optimized by determining the exhaust gasses and making scientific modifications. This alone could pay for the entire maintenance check out at today's price of gas.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
