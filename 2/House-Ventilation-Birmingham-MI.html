<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
