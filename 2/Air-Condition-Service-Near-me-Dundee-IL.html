"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced.
