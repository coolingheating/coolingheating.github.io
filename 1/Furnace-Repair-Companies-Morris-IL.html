<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
