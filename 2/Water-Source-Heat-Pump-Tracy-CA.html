<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one reaction specified the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented.

If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.  a very useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
