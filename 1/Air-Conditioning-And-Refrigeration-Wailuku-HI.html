<p>Speaking of air, radiant heating systems tend to improve indoor air quality. This is because required air heating systems flow air-borne contaminants throughout the house throughout operation, provoking a range of various negative effects. Radiant heat systems don't flow air at all, which actually improves your indoor air quality by limiting your direct exposure to high levels of airborne pollutants.<p>
<p>Just like many house improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating system can differ extensively based on the size of the house. The majority of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, homeowner must think about heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
