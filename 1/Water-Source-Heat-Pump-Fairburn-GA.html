<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, in addition to all other kinds of heatpump, have performances ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE. It's a scientific method of figuring out just how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. The majority of geothermal heatpump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for every unit of energy utilized to power the system, three to 5 units are provided as heat.<p>
