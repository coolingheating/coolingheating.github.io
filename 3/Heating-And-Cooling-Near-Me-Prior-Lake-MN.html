Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioner and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioner will not be able to cool your house effectively.

<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one action mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring usage of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
