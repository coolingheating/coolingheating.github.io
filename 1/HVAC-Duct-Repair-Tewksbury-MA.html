<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
