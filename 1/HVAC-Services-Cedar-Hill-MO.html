Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in concern was a heating, refrigeration and air  conditioning subcontractor that has worked at a variety of places at Target and other top merchants.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
