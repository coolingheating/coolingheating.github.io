Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
