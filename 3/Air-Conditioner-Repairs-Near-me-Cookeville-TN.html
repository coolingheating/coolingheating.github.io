<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Cookeville Tennessee</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>AC Technician in Cookeville TN 38501</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's tough to discover a sincere AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
