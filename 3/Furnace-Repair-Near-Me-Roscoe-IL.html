<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
