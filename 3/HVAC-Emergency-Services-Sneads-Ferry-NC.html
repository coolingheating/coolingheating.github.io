<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Sneads Ferry NC</h3>
<p>By continually developing new ideas, Hutchinson can reveal you how to save money on your air conditioning, cooling, and heating costs. As premiere heating and AC contractors, we can examine if your present ac system or heating unit fits your requirements or if a better solution exists. We can also supply tune-ups for your air conditioning unit or heater to improve performance and extend its beneficial life.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
