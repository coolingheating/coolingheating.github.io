<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space a/c provides maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
