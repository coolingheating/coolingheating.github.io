<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that gathers throughout summertimes. The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned up completely prior to colder seasons begin.

By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
