<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to change or update your system if it's 5 years of ages or older. The very best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while delivering the very same amount of cooling.<p>

For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on routine sunshine to work effectively.

This makes geothermal heating a trusted and offered source of energy.<p>

Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
