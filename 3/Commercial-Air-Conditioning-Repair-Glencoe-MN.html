<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
