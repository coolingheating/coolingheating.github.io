<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a certified agent from a business or retailer to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system. A voided service warranty will not do you any excellent must the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the beginning and work with a licensed individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
