That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
