<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar.

But much of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their houses and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal.
