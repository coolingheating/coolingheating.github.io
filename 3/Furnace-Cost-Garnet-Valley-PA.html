<p>You need to always work with an expert to conduct AC repair, for the same reason that you trust an expert plumbing or electrical expert.

Air conditioning repair is no various. You constantly want to hire an expert to repair your system, so you can have the comfort associated relying on an expert in the field.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they concern carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was six months prior to the present one ended. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
