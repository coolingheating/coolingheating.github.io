CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
