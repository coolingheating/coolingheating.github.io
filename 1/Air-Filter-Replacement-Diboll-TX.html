<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Diboll TX 75941</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
