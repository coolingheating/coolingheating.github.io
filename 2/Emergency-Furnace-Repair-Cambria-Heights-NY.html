<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

"Humidifier fever" is a common illness caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
