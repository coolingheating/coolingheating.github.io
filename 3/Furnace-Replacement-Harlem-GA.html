<p>A specific air conditioning system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard ac system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of.
