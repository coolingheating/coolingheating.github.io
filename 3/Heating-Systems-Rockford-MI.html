Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end objective.
