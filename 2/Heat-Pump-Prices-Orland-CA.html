<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Orland CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
