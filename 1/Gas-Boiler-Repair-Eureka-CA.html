<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time.

We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
