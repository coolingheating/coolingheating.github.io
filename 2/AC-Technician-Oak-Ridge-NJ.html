<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
