<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator.

Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on.
