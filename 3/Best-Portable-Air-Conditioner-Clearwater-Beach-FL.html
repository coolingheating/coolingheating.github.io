<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room.
