<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time.

Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
