<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>The primary reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services provided. The cost may not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's service warranty. Any major repairs should be covered under the producer's service warranty. However, some makers need routine maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are handled in a way that develops dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products provide a risk only. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the capacity for substantial health issue.<p>
