<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Durham NH?</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install evaluation outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
