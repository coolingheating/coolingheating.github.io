<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
