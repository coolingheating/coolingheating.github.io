Your heating and cooling contractor needs to examine and, if essential, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are great for additions due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
