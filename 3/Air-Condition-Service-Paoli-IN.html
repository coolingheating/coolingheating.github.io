<p>A customized air conditioning unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air path. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
