<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your car. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, examine the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
