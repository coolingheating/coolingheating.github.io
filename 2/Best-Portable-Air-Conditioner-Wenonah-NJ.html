<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other types of ac system, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to keep and understand.<p>
