<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
