Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its placement on your property and its maintenance, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter. Most of the time, this simply consists of some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is pretty basic to remove. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the system and ensure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated moisture, or extreme wear to the outside. They may advise that you trim back thick trees or bushes to ensure adequate airflow around the system.<p>
<p>The very first a/c unit and refrigerators employed poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in fatal accidents when they dripped.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
