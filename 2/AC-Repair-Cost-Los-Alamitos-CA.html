<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will frequently develop in ductwork, limiting airflow.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
