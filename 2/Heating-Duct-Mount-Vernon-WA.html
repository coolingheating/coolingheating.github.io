<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Amana air conditioners are a strong mid-range HVAC unit offering for the house owner looking for items in the 13 to 18 SEER variety. Amana is known for using one of the very best HVAC service warranties in business, and compressors included a Restricted Life time Replacement warranty that's good for the expected operating life of the AC unit. If you were desiring a 14 SEER air conditioner installed by them such as the Amana ASX14 design, an Amana AC unit will cost around $4,100 to install.
