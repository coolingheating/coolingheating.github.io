<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
