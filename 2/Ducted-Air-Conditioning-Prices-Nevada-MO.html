<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else limiting the flow of air. Not just will obstructed vents and registers impact your comfort, they can also result in duct leakages due to extreme atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a good idea. You won't save any money and will end up triggering more problems for your heating system.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
