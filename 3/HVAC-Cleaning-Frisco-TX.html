Kids, fetuses, and babies are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more conscious the destructive effects of lead. Kids may have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
