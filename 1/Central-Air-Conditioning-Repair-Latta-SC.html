<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
