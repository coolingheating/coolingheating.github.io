<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
