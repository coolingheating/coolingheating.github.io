Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow restriction will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>

<p>Stability Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heaters can heat your home.
