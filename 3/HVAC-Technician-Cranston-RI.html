This is normally used in a third-floor or 2nd area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
