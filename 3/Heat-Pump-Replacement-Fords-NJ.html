<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
