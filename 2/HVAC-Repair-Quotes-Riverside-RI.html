The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outdoor unit.

Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, because the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not easy, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
