<p>Homeowners may likewise presume that because a radiant flooring heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a home improvement, its installation will instantly raise their home's worth.

Perhaps Real estate agents must consider too many variables to definitively mention what a radiant heat system might add to, or deduct from, any offered asking rate. That said, property buyers seeking to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating unit will want to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
