<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
