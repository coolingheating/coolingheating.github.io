<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do.

Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
