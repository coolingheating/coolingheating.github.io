<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may see undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak to your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
