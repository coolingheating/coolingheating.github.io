He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a required part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my other half and I would not have to withstand another night without heat, during one of the coldest winters in recent memory. He also reacted to my call instantly the next morning, and coached me through a short-term fix to a problem that couldn't be resolved on the first see due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and capability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
