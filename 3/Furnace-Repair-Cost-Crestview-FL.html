<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
