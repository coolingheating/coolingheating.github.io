<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Wallingford</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold may be residing in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. But a number of the things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their homes and get worse asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and generally some other perks. Some companies offer top priority consultations to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
