<p>Buildings are created or planned to respond actively to a few of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and keep surfaces to improve their appearance, durability, or performance. In other cases, such changes subtly or even considerably modify structures in ways that may be very important to their own stability or their impact on building residents through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We might find it beneficial to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the methods used by researchers studying ecosystems, in order to acquire an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>5. Odor good naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney aroma with a tidy kitchen or clean artificial scents in laundry products and air fresheners give off dozens of different chemicals into the air.

<p>Usually the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that often, our nationally representative study discovered.

And nearly 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
