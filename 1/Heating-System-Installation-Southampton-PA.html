<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
