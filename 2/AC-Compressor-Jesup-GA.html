"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
