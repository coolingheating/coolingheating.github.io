<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Sheboygan Falls WI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and maintain comfortable and healthy environments free of pollutants.

<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter can intensify issues.
