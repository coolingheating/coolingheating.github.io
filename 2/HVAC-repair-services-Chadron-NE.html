<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.

<p>Geothermal heating is among the most efficient heating sources in terms of ecological expenses. Because the energy used to heat your house is extracted directly from the ground, it secures the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or contaminants. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical power, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating unit that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in price from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps normally need excavation to set up, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
