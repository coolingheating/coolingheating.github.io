<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
