Chemical contaminants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., office equipment; floor, wall and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
