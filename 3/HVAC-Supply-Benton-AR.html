Winter season utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
