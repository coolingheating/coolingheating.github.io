<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Localized radiant floor heat systems to be utilized in one or numerous spaces like restrooms, kitchens or utility room are quickly renovated with electric radiant flooring heat. This is much more economical on a smaller scale. Larger restorations like additions to a house might appropriate for a bigger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
