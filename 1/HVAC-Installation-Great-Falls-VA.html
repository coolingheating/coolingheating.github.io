<p>To identify the correct size of oil furnace you need for your home, determine the house's square footage and determine what zone your home is in. Speak With the U.S. Energy Info Administration's climate zone map to determine your zone number. Multiply the length and width of each room in your house that you heat and accumulate all the rooms together to get your total square video.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the tools or skills required to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician examine the system periodically.<p>
<p>The primary reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the quantity of services offered. The cost may not be beneficial if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's service warranty. Any significant repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. Nevertheless, some manufacturers need routine maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
