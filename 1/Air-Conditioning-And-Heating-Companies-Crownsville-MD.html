<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>

<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter season can exacerbate issues.
