<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again.

<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
