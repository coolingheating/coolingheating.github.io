<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Waialua HI</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have actually kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and really educated. Costs are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get rival's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was undoubtedly reasonable.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
