<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great.

He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
