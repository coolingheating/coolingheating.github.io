<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the chances are good that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>I have had the satisfaction of dealing with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly 10 years and throughout that time, they have actually always offered exemplary service.

<p>A radiator is the part of your car that keeps the engine cool and protects it from extreme heating. To be cool, the radiator needs to stay tidy - always. With time, sludge, rust and other solid deposits develop inside your automobile's radiator. These make the cooling system become blocked and less efficient. This in effect harms your automobile's performance. A regular radiator flush is enough to keep the system in shape. For this reason, make radiator flushing a part of your routine automobile maintenance schedule. For all your radiator flush requirements, call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
