<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract..
