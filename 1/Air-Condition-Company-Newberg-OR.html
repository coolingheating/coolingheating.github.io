<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top environmental hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window.
