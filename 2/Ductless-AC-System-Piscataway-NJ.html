<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time utilizing Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is skilled with these devices).

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract attempts to upsell you each time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months prior to the current one expired. She didn't require a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
