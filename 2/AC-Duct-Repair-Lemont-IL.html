<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
