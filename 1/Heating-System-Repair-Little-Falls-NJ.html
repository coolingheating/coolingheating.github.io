<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
