<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was type of unusual being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed issues. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
