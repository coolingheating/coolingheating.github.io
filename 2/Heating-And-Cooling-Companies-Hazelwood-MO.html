HVAC professionals suggest following this standard guideline when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
