Hence, for many individuals, the threats to health may be greater due to direct exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they should be placed. A lot of frequently they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly stay seated in that particular area. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to position the sensor appropriately. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
