<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
