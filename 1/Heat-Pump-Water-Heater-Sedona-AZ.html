The installation cost will be lower, but energy expenses will be higher, as much as 3 times greater than gas or electric furnaces.

<p>When installing radiant heat, you need to give serious thought to the kind of flooring covering in the home. Due to the fact that it conducts and shops heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work reasonably well. Carpeting will directly insulate the flooring from the space, reducing performance, so if you want to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with dense padding.<p>
<p>The most unsafe asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can stay and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these illness do not show up till many years after direct exposure began. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothes and devices brought house from task sites.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
