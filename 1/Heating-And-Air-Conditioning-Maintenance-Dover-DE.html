<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
