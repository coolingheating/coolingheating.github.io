<p>At present, EPA does not recommend utilizing air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. Because they only partly remove the radon decay products and do not lessen the amount of radon entering the home, the effectiveness of these gadgets is unsure.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
