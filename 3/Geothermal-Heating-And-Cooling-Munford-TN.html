<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat.

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working, stability Energy was quick to react. They showed up the next day and changed 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new furnaces can heat your house. Honestly, our home heating unit is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating unit appears less like a high-end item and more like a necessity. (Besides, heated up floorings were great enough for the Roman Empire) But before you commit to what can be a significant remodeling project, it's finest to ask yourself whether a radiant floor heating system is an appropriate service for your specific home heating requirements.<p>
