Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.

<p>They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my needs entirely by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional items.
