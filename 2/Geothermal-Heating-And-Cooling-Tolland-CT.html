<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Numerous household products release organic vapors that can cause negative health impacts. These results may consist of nose and throat inflammation, headaches, dizziness, and queasiness.

During high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
