Natural ventilation plans can utilize extremely little energy, however care must be taken to guarantee convenience. In damp or warm climates, maintaining thermal convenience solely by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
