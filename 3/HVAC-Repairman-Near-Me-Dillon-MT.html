<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
