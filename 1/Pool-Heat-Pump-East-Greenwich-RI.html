<p>If you're in the very first few years of business, you might choose to keep your service and product line simple in the meantime.

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly. This is a very typical repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensor replaced as preventative maintenance due to the fact that the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
