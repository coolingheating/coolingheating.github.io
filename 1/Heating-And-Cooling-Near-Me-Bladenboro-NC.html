<h3>AC Service in Bladenboro NC 28320</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had identified the trouble location in looking over the expense. He resolved the issue in one day, had changed the expense to what I thought about fair prior to he called back, understood what may have caused the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not happen again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>
