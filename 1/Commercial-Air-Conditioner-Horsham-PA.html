After 2 years, things began to alter. There have been awkward noises. I got it fixed and inspected. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. In general, it has actually been an excellent experience. Reliable on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the beginning. But then realized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
