<h3>House Ventilation in Ocean City New Jersey</h3>
<p>Although installation is simple and does not need much time, attempting this task is not a good concept. Unless you have training and understanding of HVAC systems, handling the installation might cause damage or installation mistakes that lead to higher utility costs and poor system efficiency.

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales man comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and should not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>
