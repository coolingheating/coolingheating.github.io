<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps run on electrical power and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heater) with the same amount of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
