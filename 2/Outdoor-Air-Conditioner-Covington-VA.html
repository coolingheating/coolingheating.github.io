<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
