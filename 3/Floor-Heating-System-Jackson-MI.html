<p>Before you go out and buy an ac system, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the ac system be?

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
