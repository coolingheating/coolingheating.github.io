<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day.

He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
