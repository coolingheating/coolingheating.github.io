<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
