<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big seller who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that regularly monitors energy usage and temperature levels in shops to save money on expenses (particularly during the night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the stores vary outside of an acceptable range that could prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination.

To identify odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, human beings exhale carbon dioxide, which in little quantities is not harmful, however may end up being harmful if high concentrations are permitted to collect. Micro-organisms or bacteria may likewise exist within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the entire work environment or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
