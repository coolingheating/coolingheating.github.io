<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
