<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered extraordinary, customized, attentive, and quality service. His communication design gets along, effective and interesting. He plainly and thoroughly discussed all problems and fixes in a way that made me positive in his ability to solve my repair issues. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a required part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my partner and I would not have to withstand another night without heat, during among the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He also responded to my call instantly the next morning, and coached me through a temporary fix to a problem that couldn't be solved on the first check out due to not available parts.

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one reaction stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to holes and fractures. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
