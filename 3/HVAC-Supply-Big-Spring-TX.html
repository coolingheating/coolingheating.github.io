Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
