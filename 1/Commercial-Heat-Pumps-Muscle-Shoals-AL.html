<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated use of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, causing holes and cracks. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  a very helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
