<p>If your a/c unit is more than 8 years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's an easy problem like debris clogging the condenser system or a worn fan belt.

Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
