Other helpful recommendation materials consist of products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
