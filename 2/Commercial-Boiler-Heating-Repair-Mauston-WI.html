<h3>HVAC Company in Mauston WI 53948</h3>
<p>UW visitors, trainees and staff members should have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out different activities. If the air quality is bad it can impact an individual's convenience, performance, and health.  The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to provide and maintain healthy and comfortable environments devoid of impurities. A crucial part of the program is reacting to and resolving concerns of structure residents about issues in their workplace.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
