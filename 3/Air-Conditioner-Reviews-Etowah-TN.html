<p>Chemical pollutants: Unstable organic substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., office devices; flooring, furniture and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
