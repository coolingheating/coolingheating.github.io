<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Strategy on investing several thousand dollars for the complete system if you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house. The size of the system determines the labor hours involved to construct the system. To equip a house with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand name new furnace or more when you think about installation fees upwards of $50 per hour.<p>
