<p>Information supplied in this safety guide is based upon existing clinical and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The requirements do not require you to change your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services must still be available for your home's systems. The "life expectancy" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Makers usually continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard enters into effect.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heater) with the same amount of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
