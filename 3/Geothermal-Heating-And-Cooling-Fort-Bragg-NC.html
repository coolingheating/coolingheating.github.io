This is generally utilized in a second or third-floor  location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
