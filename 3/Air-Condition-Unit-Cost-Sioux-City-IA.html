<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from processes or products; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
