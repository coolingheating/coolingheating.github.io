<p>Make certain there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else limiting the circulation of air. Not just will obstructed vents and signs up affect your comfort, they can also cause duct leaks due to extreme atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service strategy which normally consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
