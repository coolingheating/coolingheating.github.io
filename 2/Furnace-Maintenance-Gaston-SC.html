<p>A customized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
