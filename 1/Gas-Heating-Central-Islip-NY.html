<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
