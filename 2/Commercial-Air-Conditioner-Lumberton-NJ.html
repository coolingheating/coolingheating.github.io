It likewise prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also worsen indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system might be contaminated (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread out these toxins throughout the home.
