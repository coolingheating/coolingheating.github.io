<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Bishop CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
