<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up.
