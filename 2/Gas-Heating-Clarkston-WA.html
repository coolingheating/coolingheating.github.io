<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have been effectively dried.
