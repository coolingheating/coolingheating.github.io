<p>All cooling contractors ought to begin their evaluation of your home by performing a Cooling Contractors of America Handbook J load calculation. This figures out the heat gain your home undergoes. The calculation is fairly simple to perform and will expose what size unit you need. If the one you're considering desires to determine the best unit for your house exclusively on experience, move on to another contractor. Though highly influenced by where you live, a number of aspects affect the size unit required, including the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of doors and windows; and the orientation of your home to the sun. The calculation can also inform you to the possible benefits of updating the insulation in your home. By making your house more energy efficient, you might have the ability to decrease the size of the air conditioning unit you require.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to explain short cycling in really cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the really low temperatures.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be effectively maintained to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
