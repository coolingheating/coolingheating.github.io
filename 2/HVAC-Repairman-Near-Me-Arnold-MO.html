<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Arnold MO</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are typically near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
