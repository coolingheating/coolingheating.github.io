<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
