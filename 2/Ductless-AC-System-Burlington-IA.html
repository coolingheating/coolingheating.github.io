<p>. Prior to choosing the installation place of ac system, numerous main aspects need to be thought about.

The outside unit must likewise be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully released outside and the productivity of the whole system will drop dramatically.

<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you each time they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the present one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
