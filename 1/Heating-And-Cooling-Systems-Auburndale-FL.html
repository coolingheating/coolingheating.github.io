<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly minimizes exposure to contaminants during cooking. Incorrect change, typically suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you buy a new gas stove or range. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your home. When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
