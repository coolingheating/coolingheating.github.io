<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold love moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% assists keep them and other allergens under control. A dehumidifier (and air conditioner throughout summer months) helps reduce moisture in indoor air and successfully manages irritants, Lang says. An air conditioning unit also lowers indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -victims.<p>
<p>A specific ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the very same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
