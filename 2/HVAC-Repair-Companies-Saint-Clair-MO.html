<p>The purpose of many building ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for resident comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and constructing safety at affordable energy costs. Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor.
