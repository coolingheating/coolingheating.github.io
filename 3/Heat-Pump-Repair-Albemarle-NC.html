<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
