<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
