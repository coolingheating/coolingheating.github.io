<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
