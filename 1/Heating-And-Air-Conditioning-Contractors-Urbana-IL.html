<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
