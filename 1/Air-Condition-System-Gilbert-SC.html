<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Gilbert SC</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to determine surrogate for indoor toxins emitted by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of co2 in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application, it is sensible to minimize the use of chemical pesticides outdoors along with indoors. Depending upon the site and pest to be controlled, one or more of the following actions can be efficient: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and regular washing of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be minimized or prevented by making sure that wood structure materials do not enter into direct contact with the soil and by keeping firewood away from the home. By properly fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of yards can be dramatically decreased.<p>

<p>The predominant health result connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
