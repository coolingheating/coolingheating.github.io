<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
