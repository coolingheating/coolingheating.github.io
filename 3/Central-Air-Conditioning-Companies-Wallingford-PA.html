<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products contribute to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic substances) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heat pumps typically need excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
