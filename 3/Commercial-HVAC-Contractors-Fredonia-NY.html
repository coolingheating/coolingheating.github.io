The companies were not warned they became part of a research study, and the scientists did not manage for time invested or approaches utilized. The EPA research study prescribed and managed approaches used on a smaller sized number of houses. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both research studies have flaws, no other research study has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and methods used by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered given that these studies were carried out, the air ducts in houses have not.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
