<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators utilized hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly accidents when they leaked.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the concern and fixed really quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>My eldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
