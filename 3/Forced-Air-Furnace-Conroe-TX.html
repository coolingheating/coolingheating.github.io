<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the rate great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
