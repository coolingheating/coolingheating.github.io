He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
