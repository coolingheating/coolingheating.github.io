<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers warmth from the floor up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
