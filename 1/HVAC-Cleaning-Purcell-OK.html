<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.
