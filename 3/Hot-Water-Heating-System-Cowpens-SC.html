<h3>Solar Heating System in Cowpens SC 29330</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
