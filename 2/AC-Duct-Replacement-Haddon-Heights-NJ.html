<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your vehicle.

Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
