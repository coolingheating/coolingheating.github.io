<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, babies, and kids are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Kids may have higher exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
