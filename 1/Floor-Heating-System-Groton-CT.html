<p>A health questionnaire should be developed and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool must recognize the variety of people affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; identify where they are located within the office; show when the symptoms occur (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of specific health signs or diseases; identify all machines run in the work environment; indicate the kind of outdoors air contamination; and identify possible sources of job stress.<p>

<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers).
