<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
