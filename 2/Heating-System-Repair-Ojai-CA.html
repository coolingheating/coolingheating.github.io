<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
