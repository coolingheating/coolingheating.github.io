<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Westchester IL 60154</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
