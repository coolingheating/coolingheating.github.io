My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

If you pick to attempt to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the a/c system.
