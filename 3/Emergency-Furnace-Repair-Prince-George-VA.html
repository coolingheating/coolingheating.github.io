<p>A health questionnaire need to be established and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool must determine the number of individuals affected; specify ages and job descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they are located within the office; indicate when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of particular health signs or illnesses; determine all machines run in the office; indicate the kind of outdoors air contamination; and recognize possible sources of job tension.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
