<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently higher incomes for air conditioning tradespersons.

According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest typical salaries for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.
