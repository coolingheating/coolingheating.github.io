<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of elements including age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day.
