<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
