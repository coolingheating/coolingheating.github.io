<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace in Vanceburg KY</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
