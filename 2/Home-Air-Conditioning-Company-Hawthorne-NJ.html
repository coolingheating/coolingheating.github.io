<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Hawthorne NJ</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very efficient, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
