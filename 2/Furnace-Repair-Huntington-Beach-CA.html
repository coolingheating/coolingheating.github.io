<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a continuous temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact.

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
