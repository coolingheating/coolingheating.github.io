Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

Took care of a part that was not covered under warranty quickly and effective and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done.

I am currently on the maintance strategy. He looks after it twice a year with out needing to be reminded to do it.<p>
