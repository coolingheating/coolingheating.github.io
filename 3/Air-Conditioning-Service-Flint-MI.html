<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
