<p>Filters can get filthy easily, especially if you live in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned and replaced frequently. The heating and cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will aggravate. Examining and changing the air filters is one of the most essential elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
