<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>

This can result in the capacity for considerable health problems.<p>
