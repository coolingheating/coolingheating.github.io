<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but many use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better option.
