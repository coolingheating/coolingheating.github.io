<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really thorough in discussing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn provided excellent customer support at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance tasks we may want to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They met my needs totally by providing a professional quote with options, without pushing extra items. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
