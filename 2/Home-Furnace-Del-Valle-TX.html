<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
