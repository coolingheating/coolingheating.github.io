<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on price. It's hard to discover an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
