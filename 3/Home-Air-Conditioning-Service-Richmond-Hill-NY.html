<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
