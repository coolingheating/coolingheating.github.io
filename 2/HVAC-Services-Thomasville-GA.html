<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer.

Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective.
