A/c unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the a/c unit is large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c will need more energy to cool your house.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Unclean filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
