Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective.
