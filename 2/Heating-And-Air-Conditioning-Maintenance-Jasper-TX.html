<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will lower the system's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
