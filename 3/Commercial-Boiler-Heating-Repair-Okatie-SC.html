<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely practical in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for generating power in the form of electrical energy. The 2 operations use different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
