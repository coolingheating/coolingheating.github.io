<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
