<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Irvington NY</h3>
<p>For entire house installations, it's tough, if nearly impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing home, particularly a hydronic system. Localized glowing floor heat systems to be used in one or a number of spaces like restrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are easily refurbished with electric glowing flooring heat. This is far more affordable on a smaller scale. Bigger remodellings like additions to a home might appropriate for a bigger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
