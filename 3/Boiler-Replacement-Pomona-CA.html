<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may notice moldy or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is frequently vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
