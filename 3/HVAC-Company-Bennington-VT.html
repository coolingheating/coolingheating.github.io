<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common functions of eco-friendly houses as part of the growing green structure motion. Green tasks accounted for 20 percent of all freshly developed homes in the U.S. last year. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal post forecasted that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole housing market.<p>
