<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems at Davenport IA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor free gas that disrupts the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a range of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weak point, confusion, disorientation, and nausea, to tiredness in healthy people and episodes of increased chest pain in individuals with persistent heart disease. The signs of carbon monoxide poisoning are sometimes confused with the flu or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, babies, senior individuals, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing disease can be especially sensitive to carbon monoxide gas exposures.<p>
