One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to resist current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health impacts mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not always real that the results noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the home.
