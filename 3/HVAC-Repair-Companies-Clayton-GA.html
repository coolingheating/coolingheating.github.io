Their techs are expert and very educated. Costs are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. Due to the fact that the cost was obviously sensible, I did not trouble to get rival's quotes because of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run.

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
