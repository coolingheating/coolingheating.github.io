<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the system. Loose, defective or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes examining the advised connections in addition to temperature and pressure gauges.

Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate impurities straight from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
