<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement..

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
