<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a continuous temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0.
