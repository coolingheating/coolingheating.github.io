<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of eco-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure movement. Green projects accounted for 20 percent of all newly constructed homes in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal article anticipated that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole housing market.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we provide advice to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older system.<p>
