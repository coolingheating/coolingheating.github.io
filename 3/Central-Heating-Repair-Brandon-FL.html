<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0.
