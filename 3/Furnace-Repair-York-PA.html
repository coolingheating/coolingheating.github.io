<h3>Boiler Maintenance at York PA - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Sometimes, heating repairs are merely not possible. Possibly your furnace is too old, your heat pump is too harmed, or your boiler simply can't be fixed.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
