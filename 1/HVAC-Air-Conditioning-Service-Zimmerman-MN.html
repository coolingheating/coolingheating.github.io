<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up.
