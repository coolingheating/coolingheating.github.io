A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of numerous spaces with one external unit.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

Additionally, during winter season, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water along with its primary purpose of supplying space heating. This suggests that cost savings are still recognized throughout the colder duration. In fact, a desuperheater reduces winter season water heating costs by around 50 percent.<p>
