<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
