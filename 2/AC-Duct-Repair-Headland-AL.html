<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers warmth from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>

Speak With the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax deductions available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heater where you live.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues.
