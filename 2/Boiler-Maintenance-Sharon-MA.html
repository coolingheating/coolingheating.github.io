<p>Expert heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC experts advise following this standard guideline when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>

In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
