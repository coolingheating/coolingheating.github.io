<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply recommendations to change instead of repair a heater. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>My oldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Changing your old furnace with a new, more efficient design can fight volatile energy prices, minimizing your heating costs by as much as 45%. Developments in heating technology have actually caused systems that contaminate less, improve comfort, and last longer. A twenty to thirty years of age furnace usually has an AFUE of about 65%. The most affordable effectiveness allowed by law for new gas designs is 78%, and there are various choices that accomplish 98%, for near total performance.<p>
