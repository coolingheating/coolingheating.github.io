<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal comfort inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home.

That said, property buyers wanting to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating system will want to pay a premium for a home that includes one.<p>
