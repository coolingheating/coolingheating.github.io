<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the US your house is located, the local region's environment can change considerably. A house situated in the South would require an AC unit with a size efficient in cooling your home due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would need a much larger heating capability also which will impact expenses. See the chart listed below for the typical central air conditioner replacement costs by TONS.<p>
