<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold might be residing in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However many of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their houses and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>

<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). However, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The main danger of mold development, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic homes of the spore cell wall. More severe than a lot of allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes personallies that currently have asthma, a major respiratory disease.<p>
<p>Great Item! Delivery was sort of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time.

<p>Prior to cooling or installing any brand-new heating system in a house, it is required to re decrease the energy and assess load of the house. A more energy efficient home will not just minimize the cost of a new system and energy expenses, but it will significantly enhance the comfort of your house. Before we style and set up any systems, we schedule a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic enhancements typically include adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise numerous certified home Energy Star auditors and installation specialists. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>
