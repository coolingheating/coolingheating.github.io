<p>Sean was really valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the technicians believed they just didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
