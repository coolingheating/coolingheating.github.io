<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
