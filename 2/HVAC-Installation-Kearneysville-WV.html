<p>Your Review This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these gadgets). I have absolutely nothing but excellent things to state - he has taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick response - quick resolution.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract attempts to upsell you each time they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was six months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
