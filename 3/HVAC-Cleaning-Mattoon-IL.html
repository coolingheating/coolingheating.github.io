<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any airflow limitation will lower the system's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Most respectable HVAC technicians will offer complimentary estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who attempt to provide you a totally free quote over the phone, as it may not accurately reflect what they will find as soon as they check out the system.
