<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was really delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>
