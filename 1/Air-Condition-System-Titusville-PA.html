However, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
