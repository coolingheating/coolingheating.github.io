You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the opportunities are great that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's finest to replace the capacitor.<p>

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you each time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
