<p>Ensure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the flow of air. Not only will blocked vents and registers impact your convenience, they can likewise cause duct leaks due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a good concept. You won't save any additional money and will wind up triggering more problems for your heating unit.<p>
