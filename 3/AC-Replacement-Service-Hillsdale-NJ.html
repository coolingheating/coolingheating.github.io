<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Hillsdale NJ Home</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the growth of biological contaminants are moist or wet structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Various fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and family plants.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Radiant Heating System in Hillsdale NJ 07642</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
