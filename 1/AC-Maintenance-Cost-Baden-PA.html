<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions due to the fact that they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>

The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
