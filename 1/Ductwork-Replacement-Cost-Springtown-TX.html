<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Switch off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work properly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>

<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
