<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Pawleys Island SC Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
