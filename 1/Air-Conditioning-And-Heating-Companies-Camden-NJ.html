<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>

We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to check AC systems even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
