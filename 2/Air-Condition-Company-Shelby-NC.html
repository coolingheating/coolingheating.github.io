<p>The purpose of many structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and constructing security at sensible energy costs. Load determining is described as the Handbook J calculation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone. Just like determining the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
