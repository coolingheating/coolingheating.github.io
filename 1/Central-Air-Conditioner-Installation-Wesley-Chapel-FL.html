<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not provide contracts.  The so called credible companies swindle more individuals than the fly by night outfits. Due to the fact that I attempted to work for them, I know. Since 90% of them are crooks, I stop. They stroll in with or without a contract and begin selling you things you do not require. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as an expert to confirm the so called problems and remedies. 9 out of 10, I inspect are completely incorrect.<p>
<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and ought to not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the options for your requirements and you choose if you need it.<p>
