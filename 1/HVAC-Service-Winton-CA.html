<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a property owner can require to select products that will prevent indoor air problems from taking place - a number of them are mentioned here. First, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, think about using solid wood products. Second of all, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

<p>Some HVAC technicians offer service agreements to their clients, supplying routine maintenance of heating and cooling systems.

Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter once every 3 months. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
