<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
