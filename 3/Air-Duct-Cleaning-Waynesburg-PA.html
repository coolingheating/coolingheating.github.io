<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same.

Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and treat-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
