<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
