<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
