<h3>How to Have the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Wellsboro PA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
