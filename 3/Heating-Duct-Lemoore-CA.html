<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Nick B. provided remarkable, tailored, attentive, and quality service. His interaction design is friendly, appealing and reliable. He clearly and thoroughly explained all issues and fixes in a way that made me confident in his capability to fix my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my other half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in recent memory. He likewise responded to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a short-lived fix to an issue that could not be resolved on the very first see due to unavailable parts.

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
