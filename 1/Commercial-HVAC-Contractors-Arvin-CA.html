<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Arvin CA 93203</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system".

The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
