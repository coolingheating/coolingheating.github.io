<h3>Ducted Air Conditioning Prices in Skowhegan ME 04976</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
