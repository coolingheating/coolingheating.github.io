<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Checotah OK?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Both should be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
