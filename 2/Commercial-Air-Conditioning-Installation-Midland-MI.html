<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, given that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not simple, considering that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
