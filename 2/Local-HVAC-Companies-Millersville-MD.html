<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end objective.
