Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living.

R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be bought and used by qualified HVAC specialists. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by many individuals.<p>
