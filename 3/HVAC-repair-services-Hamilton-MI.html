<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Hamilton MI</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
