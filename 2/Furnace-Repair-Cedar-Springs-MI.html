<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Cedar Springs MI 49319</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the tools or skills necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still essential to have a professional technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may become blocked, decreasing air circulation quality, distribution, and volume. They likewise might become places for molds and bacteria to be and grow distributed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be appropriately kept to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
