<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

The efforts in which these procedures are shown in the field has led to the development of an important database of building ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
