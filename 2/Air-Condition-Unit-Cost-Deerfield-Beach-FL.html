<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
