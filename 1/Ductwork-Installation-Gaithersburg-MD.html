<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>My eldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
