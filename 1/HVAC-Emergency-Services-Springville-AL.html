<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- provide All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical energy, a heatpump is a cost-effective solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, however in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>I'll start with a gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
