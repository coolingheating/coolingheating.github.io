As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and efficiency if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, humans exhale carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not poisonous, but might become hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Micro-organisms or germs might also be present within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the entire office or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
