<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
