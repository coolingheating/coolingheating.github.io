<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
