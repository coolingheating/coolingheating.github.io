<p>A primary factor in the avoidance of health symptoms is an effective, appropriately developed and running ventilation system.

<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the compressor, condenser, and evaporator are all situated in one cabinet, which normally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete piece next to the house's structure. This type of ac system also is used in little commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts come from inside your home through the home's exterior wall or roofing system to get in touch with the packaged a/c, which is typically located outdoors. Packaged ac system often consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This combination of a/c and central heating unit eliminates the need for a separate furnace inside.<p>
