<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a warm water supply.

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a few years earlier.<p>
