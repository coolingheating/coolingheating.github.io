<p>Indoor air pollution is triggered by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating.

All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the radiant heat system has actually been running for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
