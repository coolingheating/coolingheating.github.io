<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
