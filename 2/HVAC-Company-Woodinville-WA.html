<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Support! Environment Pro is reputable and really cared about us and our circumstance. We got back one night to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely glad to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right prior to a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are great for additions because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
