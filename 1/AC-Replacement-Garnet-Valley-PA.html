<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
