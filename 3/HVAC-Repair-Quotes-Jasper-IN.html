He committed to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few sensible ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality.

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
