<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
