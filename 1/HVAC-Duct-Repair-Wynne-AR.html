<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
