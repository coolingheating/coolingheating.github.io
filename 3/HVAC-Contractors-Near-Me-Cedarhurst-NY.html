<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Cedarhurst NY?</h3>
<p>Sometimes, heating repairs are merely not possible. Perhaps your furnace is too old, your heatpump is too harmed, or your boiler just can't be fixed.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
