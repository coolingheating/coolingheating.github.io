<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
