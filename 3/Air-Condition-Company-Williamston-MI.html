<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Williamston MI Home</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
