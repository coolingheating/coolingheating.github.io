<p>I am really pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
