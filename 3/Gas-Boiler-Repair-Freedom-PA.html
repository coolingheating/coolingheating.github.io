<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold.

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
