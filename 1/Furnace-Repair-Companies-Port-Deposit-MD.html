<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability.

Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Port Deposit MD 21904</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
