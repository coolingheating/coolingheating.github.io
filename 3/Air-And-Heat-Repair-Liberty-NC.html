These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result.

<p>Many commercial buildings use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can likewise make use of natural ventilation by opening doors or windows.
