The EPA study prescribed and controlled methods used on a smaller sized variety of houses.

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
