<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
