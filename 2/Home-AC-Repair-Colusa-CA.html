<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
