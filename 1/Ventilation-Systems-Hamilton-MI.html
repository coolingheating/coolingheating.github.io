<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year.

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
