<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Business in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced reasonably, have actually managed the one repair I needed well, and are always on-time and professional. Have been through a few companies for many years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I've had the chance to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been great.<p>

Even when it was news my customer most likely would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, its a company design they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
