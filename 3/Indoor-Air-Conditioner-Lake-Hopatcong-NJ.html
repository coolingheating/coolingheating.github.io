<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
