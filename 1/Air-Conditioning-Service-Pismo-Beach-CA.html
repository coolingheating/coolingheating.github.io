<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Pismo Beach CA</h3>

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution.

Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
