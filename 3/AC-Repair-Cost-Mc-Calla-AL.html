These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow.
