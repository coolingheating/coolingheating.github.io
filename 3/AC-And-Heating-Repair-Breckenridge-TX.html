<p>Air contaminants can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leakages.

To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
