Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
