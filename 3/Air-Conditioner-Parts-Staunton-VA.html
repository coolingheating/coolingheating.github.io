<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the right temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
