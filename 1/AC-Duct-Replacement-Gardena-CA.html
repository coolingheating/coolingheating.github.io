<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the very same indoor air problems as single-family houses due to the fact that much of the pollution sources, such as the interior structure products, home furnishings, and home items, are comparable.
