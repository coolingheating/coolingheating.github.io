Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make sure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2).

If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
