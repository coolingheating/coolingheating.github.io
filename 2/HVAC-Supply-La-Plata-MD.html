<p>When our furnace was dying, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were practical and helpful, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a much better offer, for extraordinary service.

<p>Many disconnect blocks contain 2 cartridge fuses. Inspect them before you continue with repairs (Picture 3). A blown fuse suggests a failing part inside the condensing unit.
