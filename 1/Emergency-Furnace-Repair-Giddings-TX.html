<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
