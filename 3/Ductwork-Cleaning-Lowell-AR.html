<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
