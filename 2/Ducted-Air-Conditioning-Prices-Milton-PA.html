<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
