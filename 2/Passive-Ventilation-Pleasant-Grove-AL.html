<p>Today's house radiant heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a home is the floor mass. Radiators can be in your area located in one location like a restroom floor or be installed across the entire sub-surface of the house's floors.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
