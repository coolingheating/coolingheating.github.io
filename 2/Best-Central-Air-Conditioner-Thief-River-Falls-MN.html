<p>Specific immediate results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently challenging to figure out if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is necessary to take notice of the time and place the symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some impacts might be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, cooling, or heating conditions prevalent in the home.<p>

As HVAC technicians regularly come into contact with electrical wiring, they risk being electrocuted. They can also suffer other types of abrasions and burns to the skin. Although there are dangers connected with the job, it is generally carried out securely as long as correct care is taken.<p>
