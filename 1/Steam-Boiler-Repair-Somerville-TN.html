<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
