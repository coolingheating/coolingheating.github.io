<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Mcalester OK?</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of changing or exchanging air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air circulating, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
