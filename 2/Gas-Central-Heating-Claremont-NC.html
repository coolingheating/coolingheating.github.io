<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures build up inside your home, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
<h3>Central Heating Installation in Claremont North Carolina</h3>
<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is frosty. Also, if the air conditioning unit smells bad, there might be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you install, it's vital that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your home will not be heated adequately and the system will need to continuously go to attempt to heat the whole house, which will increase heating costs.<p>
<p>Gas furnaces do feature some drawbacks. The most significant disadvantage is also the outcome of the combustion process. This process produces exhaust gases, consisting of carbon monoxide gas, which need to be vented to the outside of the home. Carbon monoxide is an odor-free gas, and is highly toxic in greater concentrations. Since of this, a malfunctioning gas furnace or a venting problem might put your house's residents in real threat. It is very important to have your gas furnace routinely serviced, and to make certain your house has a carbon monoxide gas alarm set up.<p>

<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Claremont NC</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the various homes they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile houses, homes, high-rise condos, row housing, and so on). No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), proper purification, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is operating securely and not adding to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
