<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being blocked with particles that can limit airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down entirely. By comparison, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can typically be done in simply a few minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality.
