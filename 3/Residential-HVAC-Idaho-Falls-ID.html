<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
