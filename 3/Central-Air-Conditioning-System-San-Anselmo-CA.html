<p>Specialist heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC professionals suggest following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
