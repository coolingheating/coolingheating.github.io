<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
