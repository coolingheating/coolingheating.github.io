<h3>Central Heating Installation in Mahomet Illinois</h3>

<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved problems. I would recommend this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
