<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced.

In this case, the control system is very crucial to preserving an appropriate temperature.<p>
<p>Because heating & cooling work may also need installing or repairing plumbing to supply oil or gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor might also be needed to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a certified plumber on call. However, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this profession. When getting a price quote, be sure to ask not only if a company is accredited, however also what kind of license it holds.<p>
