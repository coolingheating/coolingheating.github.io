<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure products, smoking, household products, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in manufactured products. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a part of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
