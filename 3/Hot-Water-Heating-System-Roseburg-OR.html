<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
