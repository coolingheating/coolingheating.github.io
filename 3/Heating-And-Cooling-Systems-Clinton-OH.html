Every maintenance job might need absolutely various steps and procedures than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being checked.

<p>The first ac system and refrigerators used combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

Radiant systems work with electrical, natural gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.
