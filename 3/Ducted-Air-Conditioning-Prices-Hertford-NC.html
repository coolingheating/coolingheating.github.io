<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>

Work environment temperatures must be preserved between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air circulation should be prevented.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me.
