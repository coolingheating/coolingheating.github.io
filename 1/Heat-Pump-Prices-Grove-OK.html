Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building products, smoking, home products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units.

<p>When attempting to figure out how typically I must replace my air conditioning filters, there are numerous things to take into consideration. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how typically your cooling filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right decision on how frequently your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one a/c filter need replacing more frequently.<p>

It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
