<h3>The Way to Get the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Havana FL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
