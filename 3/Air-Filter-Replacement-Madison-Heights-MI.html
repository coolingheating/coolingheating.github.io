<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
