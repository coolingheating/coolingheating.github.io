<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Searcy AR</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>I have been using them for years for my services, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control.

Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
