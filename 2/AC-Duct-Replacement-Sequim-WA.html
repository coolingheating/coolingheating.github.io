AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Picture 6).<p>
