<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Burlington WA</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of scientific proof has actually indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that individuals invest roughly 90 percent of their time indoors. Thus, for many people, the threats to health might be higher due to direct exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
