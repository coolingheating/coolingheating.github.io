<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might see unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues.

But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
