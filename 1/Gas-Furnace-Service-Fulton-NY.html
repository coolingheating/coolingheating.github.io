<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
