<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
