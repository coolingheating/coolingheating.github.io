<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
