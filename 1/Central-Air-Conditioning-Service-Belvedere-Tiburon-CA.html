<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
