While toxins commonly found in indoor air can cause lots of harmful effects, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are needed to produce particular health issue.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
