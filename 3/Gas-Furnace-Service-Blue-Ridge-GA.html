<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Company in Blue Ridge</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>
