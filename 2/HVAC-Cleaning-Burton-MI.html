<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
