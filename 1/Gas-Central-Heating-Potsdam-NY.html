<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
