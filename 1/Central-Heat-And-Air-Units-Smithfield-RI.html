<p>Do you need to replace or repair part of your home's HVAC system? With those warm Washington summertimes and cold winters, it is essential for your home to be geared up with a high-performing cooling and heating system throughout the year.

<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>The main reason property owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services offered. If the system is brand-new and still under a producer's warranty, the cost might not be worthwhile. Any significant repairs must be covered under the producer's guarantee.
