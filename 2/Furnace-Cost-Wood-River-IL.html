<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
