<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
