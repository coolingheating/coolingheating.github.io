<h3>Electric Furnace in Franklin MA 02038</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they detected the issue and repaired really rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years back and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
