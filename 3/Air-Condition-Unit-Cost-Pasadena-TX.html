<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.

The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
