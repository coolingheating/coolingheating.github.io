<p>These concepts-- and desire to suffer through the heat-- may already be changing. Though only 33 percent of Seattle housing systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new housing units have actually been integrated in the four years considering that or are currently under building. The large majority of these units are mixed-use or multi-family, where cooling is more of a market standard, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC specialists typically discover themselves operating in uncomfortable and confined areas, at severe heights, and in some cases in unsafe conditions like extreme weather (to service outside heat pumps and heat exchangers). They face numerous prospective dangers, consisting of electrical shocks, burns, muscle stress from lifting heavy devices, and breathing issues brought on by the dangerous chemicals and refrigerants they manage.<p>
