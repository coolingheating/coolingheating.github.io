<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced.
