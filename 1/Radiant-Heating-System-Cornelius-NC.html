<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
