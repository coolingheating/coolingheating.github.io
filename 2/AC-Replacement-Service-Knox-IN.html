Since it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
