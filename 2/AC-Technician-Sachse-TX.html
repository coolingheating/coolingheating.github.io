<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building products, cigarette smoking, home items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in produced products.

<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
