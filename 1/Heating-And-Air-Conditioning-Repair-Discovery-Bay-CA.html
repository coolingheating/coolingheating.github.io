Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does offer standards about the most common IAQ workplace complaints.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the basic indoor air quality meets a certain standard. Occupational direct exposure limitations noted in health and wellness policies and the Threshold Limit Values ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to avoid illness or specific impacts (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial scenarios.
