<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are normally not really effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not attain an efficiency greater than 90%.
