<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally triggered by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in majority the office indoor air examinations it has conducted. Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the same to be true. These examinations revealed that correct ventilation is necessary in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Immediate effects might show up after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are typically short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
