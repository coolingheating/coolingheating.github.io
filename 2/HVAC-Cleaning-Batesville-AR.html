<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
