<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heating unit can also be linked to a gadget known as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat generated from the ground source heatpump compressor and uses it to heat water. This means that this device can also supply complimentary hot water for domestic use in addition to its traditional geothermal heating and cooling function.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
