Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
