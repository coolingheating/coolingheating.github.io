<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal.
