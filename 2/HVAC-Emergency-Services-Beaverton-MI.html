<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
