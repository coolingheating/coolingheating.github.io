<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
