<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room.
