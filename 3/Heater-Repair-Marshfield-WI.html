<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the exact same indoor air issues as single-family houses due to the fact that a lot of the contamination sources, such as the interior building materials, furnishings, and home products, are comparable.
