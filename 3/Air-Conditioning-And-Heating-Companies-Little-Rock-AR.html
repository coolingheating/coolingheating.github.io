<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Little Rock AR?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We selected getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
