<p>When installing a wall sensor, consider the height at which they should be positioned. Many frequently they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if individuals mostly stay seated in that particular location.

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside buildings are usually near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
