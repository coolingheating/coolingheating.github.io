<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the floor up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
