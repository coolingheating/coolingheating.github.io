<p>Expert heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC professionals recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than designs made 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to change or update your system if it's 5 years of ages or older.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
