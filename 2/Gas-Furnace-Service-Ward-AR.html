<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
