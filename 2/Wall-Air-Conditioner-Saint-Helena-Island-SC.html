<p>There are lots of actions a homeowner can require to select products that will avoid indoor air issues from occurring - a couple of them are pointed out here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about utilizing solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
