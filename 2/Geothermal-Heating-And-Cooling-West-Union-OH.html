<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater require fairly little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is necessary to keep the system operating efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be looked for leaks, the system should be flushed occasionally to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems need to be inspected at least twice per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical type of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of homes in chillier climates were warmed by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floors warmed. In turn, the objects in the room, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
