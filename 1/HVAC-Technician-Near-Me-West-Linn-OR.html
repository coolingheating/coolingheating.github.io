<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in West Linn OR</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes far more serious with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have been completed, the last task is to check the system to make certain it cools effectively. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This last check might point out faults in the thermostat, which might be as simple as a need to replace batteries. A failure to switch on may just include a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any concerns or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where proper.<p>
