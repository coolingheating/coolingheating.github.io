(If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
