<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Burlington NJ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
