<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every 3 months. Throughout high use months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
