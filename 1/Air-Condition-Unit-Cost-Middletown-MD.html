Exceptional Customer Service! Climate Pro is reputable and genuinely appreciated us and our situation. We got home one night to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might look for and acquire it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated house once again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right prior to a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
