Many common structure products used prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products.

<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
