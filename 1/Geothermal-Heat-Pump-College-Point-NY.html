<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
