<h3>HVAC Contractors Near Me in Berkeley California</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>AC Repair Cost in Berkeley CA 94704</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the skills or tools needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to provide threshold alerts. If, for instance, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your monitoring devices to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the proper action to deal with the circumstance immediately.<p>
<p>The primary health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
