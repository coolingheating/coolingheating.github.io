<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
