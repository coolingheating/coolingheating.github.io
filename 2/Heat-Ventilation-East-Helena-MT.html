<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, polite, and respected my house by always using boot coverings when entering my house. He demonstrated the points of examination and also advised I have a UV light set up due to a little buildup of mold accumulating in the air handler, which he completely cleaned the exterior and inspected compressor coils as well as ensured the wetness discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a shop vacuum. He likewise removed the leaves that built up inside the interior of the compressor system and recommended an option to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I received a comprehensive email report of the evaluation describing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I highly suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
