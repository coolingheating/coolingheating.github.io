<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow constraint will decrease the unit's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>

At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
