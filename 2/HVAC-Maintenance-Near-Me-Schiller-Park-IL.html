<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day.
