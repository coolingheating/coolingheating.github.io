<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A great place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one element (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
