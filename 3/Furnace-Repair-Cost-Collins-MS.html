<p>While contaminant levels from specific sources might not pose a significant health threat on their own, many houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a major risk from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to minimize the danger from existing sources and to prevent new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can lower the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes throat, eye, and nose irritation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually linked exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>When car air conditioning systems break down, refrigerant leakages. Not just is refrigerant hazardous to the environment, it's also harmful to your vehicle. Leaking refrigerant can harm your car's evaporator and compressor. Getting a car a/c unit service at the very first sign of problem will save you both cash and time. Come to Firestone Total Car Care for an AC service repair prior to any damage spreads.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
