<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.
