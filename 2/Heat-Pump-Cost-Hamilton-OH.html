In tasks where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

Because a system is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
