<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was kind of weird being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: They were fantastic! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs entirely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
