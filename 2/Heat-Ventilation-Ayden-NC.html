While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
