<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, work environments and schools matters, particularly given that we spend the majority of our lives inside. A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as merely radiant systems.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>
