<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, think about potential effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's instructions, especially guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system effectively adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
