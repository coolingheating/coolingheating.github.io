<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
