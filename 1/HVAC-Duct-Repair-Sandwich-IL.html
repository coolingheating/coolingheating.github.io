<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power must not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not simple, because it takes into consideration not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
