If the air filter is great to go, examine the furnace blower for blocking and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it.

<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface of a floor warms the lower half of the space, covering residents in heat at a lower total temperature-- sometimes as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heater."
