<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work appropriately after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
