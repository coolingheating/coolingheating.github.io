<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

Installing new ductwork for the entire home will cost approximately in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
