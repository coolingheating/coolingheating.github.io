An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.
