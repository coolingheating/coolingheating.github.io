<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outdoor system.

However, the calculation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
