<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally caused by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the main issue in majority the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually carried out. Investigations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the same to be true. These investigations exposed that appropriate ventilation is important in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a range of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined structure materials, home furnishings, and mold as serious issues, but much of the danger also comes from burning things. For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big problem in the developing world.<p>
