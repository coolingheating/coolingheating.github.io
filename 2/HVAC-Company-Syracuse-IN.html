<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that gathers during summers. The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heater burners are checked and cleaned up completely prior to cooler seasons start.

If your furnace is in a really bad condition, maybe it is time to start thinking of buying a new one.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
