Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
