<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
