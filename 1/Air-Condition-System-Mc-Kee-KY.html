But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
