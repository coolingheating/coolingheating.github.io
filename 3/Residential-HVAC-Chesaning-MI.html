<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales male pertains to your home he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
