But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
