<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
