As a society, we make certain that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we do not think enough about direct exposure to all the important things we place in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right now, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor begins however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts.
