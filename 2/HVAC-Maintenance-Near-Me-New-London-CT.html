<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
