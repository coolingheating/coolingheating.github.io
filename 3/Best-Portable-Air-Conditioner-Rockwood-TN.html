<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your car. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological impurities are wet or damp structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and household plants.<p>
