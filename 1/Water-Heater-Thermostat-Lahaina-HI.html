<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, oil or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve approximately 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour.
