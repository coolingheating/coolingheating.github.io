<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
