Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Such elements consist of the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas given off by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
