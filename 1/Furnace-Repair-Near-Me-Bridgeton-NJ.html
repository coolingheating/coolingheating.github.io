<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
