<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
