<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins which unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is improperly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, including contaminated soil tracked inside, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Many HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that enable homeowner to control the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in home to save money on the energy bills and guarantee the system isn't overburdened. An expert technician will examine the thermostat throughout the yearly maintenance to make sure the actual temperature and the temperature on the thermostat matches.

On those days when you simply can't appear to warm up and find you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating.

In turn, the things in the space, like furniture and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
