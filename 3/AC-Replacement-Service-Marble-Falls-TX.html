Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
