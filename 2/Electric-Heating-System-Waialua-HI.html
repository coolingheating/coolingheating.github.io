<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
