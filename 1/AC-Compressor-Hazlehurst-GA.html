<p>While pollutant levels from private sources might not present a significant health danger on their own, the majority of homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that many people can take both to minimize the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to act that can reduce the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are typically not really effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not achieve a performance higher than 90%.

You pay more for the installation as well since a drain needs to be installed.<p>
