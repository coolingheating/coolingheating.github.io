<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Setting up a/c costs in between $3,350 and $5,912 with most homeowners reporting investing $4,631 usually. This rate is typical of installing a brand-new AC unit to your forced air furnace.
