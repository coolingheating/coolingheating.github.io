<p>The Texas Departement of State Health Services (DSHS) Indoor Air Quality Branch has developed a listing of certified indoor air experts in Texas The list represents people holding a professional certification connecting to indoor air quality from various companies. Please note that DSHS does NOT certify or accredit these individuals as indoor air specialists.

<p>During normal furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can develop on internal elements. Airborne elements from typical home items and surfaces can cause formicary corrosion within your HVAC equipment. Left unchecked, these problems can result in loss of efficiency and even worse, breakdown of component products and a shorter furnace life-span Gradually, crucial parts like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can begin rusting, leading to reduced efficiency.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system can produce a lot of water due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
