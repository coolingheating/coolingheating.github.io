<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on price. It's tough to find a truthful AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues prior to we offer guidance to change rather than repair a heater. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may discover unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your physician about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
