<p>A specialized ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic air conditioner in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
