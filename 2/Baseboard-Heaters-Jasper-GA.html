<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Service! Environment Pro is dependable and genuinely cared about us and our situation. We got back one evening to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated home again. What's most incredible was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week!

As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
