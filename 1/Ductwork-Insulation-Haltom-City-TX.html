<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
