<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>Although installation is easy and doesn't need much time, trying this task is not an excellent concept. Unless you have training and understanding of HVAC systems, handling the installation might trigger damage or installation errors that result in higher energy expenses and bad system efficiency. In addition, HVAC systems have warranties that need certified specialists to perform installation. You might void the service warranties by handling that job.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heater the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is really vital to preserving a proper temperature level.<p>
<p>Gas heating systems do feature some disadvantages. The biggest drawback is also the result of the combustion process. This process releases exhaust gases, consisting of carbon monoxide gas, which have to be vented to the outside of the home. Carbon monoxide gas is an odor free gas, and is highly poisonous in greater concentrations. A malfunctioning gas furnace or a venting problem might put your house's occupants in real danger because of this. It is incredibly crucial to have your gas furnace routinely serviced, and to ensure your house has a carbon monoxide alarm installed.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
