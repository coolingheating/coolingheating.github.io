<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They include hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids might have higher direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant might cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
