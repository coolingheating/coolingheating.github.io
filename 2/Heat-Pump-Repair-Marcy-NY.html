<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on.
