<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment.

We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities.

<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a circulation system. Metal pipes are hardly ever utilized due to long-lasting corrosive concerns.

<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
