<h3>Tips for Quick Furnace Repair in Jacksonville FL</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floorings. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor pollutants and assists tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
