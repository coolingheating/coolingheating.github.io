<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Area control involves moving the pollutant source far from residents and even transferring prone occupants.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor environmental quality") describes how inside air can affect a person's capability, comfort, and health to work. It can consist of temperature level, humidity, absence of outside air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals. Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does supply standards about the most typical IAQ work environment problems.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Specialists suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and normally are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
