<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Strategy how you will broaden your client base throughout the years to remain lucrative, although initially, you might start your HVAC organisation with limited threat. Start part-time with a set amount of hours you want to work in your service. For example, you might wish to work 4 hours each weekend and then broaden it to include a 4 more hours for 3 or four days during the week. Recognize how many clients you can service within a week based upon the hours you wish to dedicate to business and your monetary goals.<p>
