<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Granite Falls</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
