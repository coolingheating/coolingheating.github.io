<p>I have actually been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
