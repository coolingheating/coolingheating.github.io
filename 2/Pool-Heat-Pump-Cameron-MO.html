<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that collects throughout summers. The best thing to do is ensuring that the heater burners are inspected and cleaned completely prior to chillier seasons start. Constantly make certain that the furnace is cleaned up yearly to avoid soot and condensation which causes burners to stop working appropriately. Maybe it is time to begin thinking about purchasing a new one if your furnace is in a very poor condition.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home.

<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the specialists believed they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
