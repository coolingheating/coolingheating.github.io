<p>All heater have some level of air purification. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some fundamental maintenance.

<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it concerns central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>

One quarter have actually never cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
