<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
