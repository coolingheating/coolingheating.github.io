<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) refers to less regular (but often more severe) cases of people becoming ill after being in a particular building at a particular time.

<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Spot Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans need to be installed in all kitchens and restrooms. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide. The most effective fans are durable and quiet. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to ensure the fans run for an adequate time period. A good general rule is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Room air conditioners feature a thermostat sensing unit, located behind the control board, which measures the temperature of air coming into the evaporative coil. If the sensor is knocked out of position, the a/c might cycle continuously or behave unpredictably. The sensing unit ought to be near the coil but not touching it; change its position by carefully bending the wire that holds it in place.<p>
