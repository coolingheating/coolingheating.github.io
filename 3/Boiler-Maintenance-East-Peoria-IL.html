<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
