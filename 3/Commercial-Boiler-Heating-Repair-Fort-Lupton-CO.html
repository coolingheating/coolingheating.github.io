<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in hidden or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic.

Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
