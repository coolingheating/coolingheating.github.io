<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in Round Rock</h2>

<p>The first ac system and refrigerators employed combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.
