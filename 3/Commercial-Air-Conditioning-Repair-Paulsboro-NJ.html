<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

The majority of contemporary hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ).

The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
