<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
