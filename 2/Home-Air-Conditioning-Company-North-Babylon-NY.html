Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.
