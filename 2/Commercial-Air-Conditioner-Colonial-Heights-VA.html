<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in Colonial Heights VA</h3>
<p>Everybody deal with a variety of threats to our health as we set about our day-to-day lives. Driving in cars, flying in airplanes, participating in recreational activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all posture varying degrees of risk. Some risks are just inescapable. Some we choose to accept since to do otherwise would limit our ability to lead our lives the way we desire. And some are risks we might decide to prevent if we had the chance to make informed choices. Indoor air contamination is one danger that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
