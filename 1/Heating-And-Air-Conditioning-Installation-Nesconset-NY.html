<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically higher than numerous heatpump alternatives, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the model you buy.
