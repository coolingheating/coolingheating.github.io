<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological pollutants are damp or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease brought on by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have actually been finished, the last job is to test the system to ensure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This final check may explain faults in the thermostat, which might be as basic as a requirement to replace batteries. A failure to turn on might simply include a tripped circuit breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any problems or concerns and makes suggestions about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
