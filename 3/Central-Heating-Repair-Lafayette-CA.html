<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and homes matters, especially because we invest most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Radiant heating offers a variety of unique benefits over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not need to fret about duct leaks, which are accountable for output losses of approximately 30% in other heating system types.

A home warmed by a glowing system will warm up much faster, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the many benefits that a radiant heating system can use you.<p>
