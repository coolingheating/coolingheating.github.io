<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be taken to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners must be alert to the development of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization procedures should not be carried out up until these issues have been remedied.<p>
