Talk to your state's contractor's licensing board online to ensure that no client grievances have actually been filed and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and valid.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
