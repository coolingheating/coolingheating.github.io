<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heating system, you may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons.

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
