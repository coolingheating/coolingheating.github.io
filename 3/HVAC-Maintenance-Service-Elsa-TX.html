<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
