<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one response specified the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repeated use of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.. a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
