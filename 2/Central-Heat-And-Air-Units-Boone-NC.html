Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; floor, furnishings and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
