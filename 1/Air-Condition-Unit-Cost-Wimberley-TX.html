<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly.
