<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements totally by providing a professional quote with options, without pushing additional products. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
