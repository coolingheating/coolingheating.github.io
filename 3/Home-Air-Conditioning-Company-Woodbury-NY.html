<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, however it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
