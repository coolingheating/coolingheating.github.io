The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most economical if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
