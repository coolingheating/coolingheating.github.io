<h3>The Way to Have the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Madison OH</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family house installation organisation entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
