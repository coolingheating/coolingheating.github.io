<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They met my requirements totally by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
