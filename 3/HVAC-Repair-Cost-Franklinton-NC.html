The task of an HVAC technician is fairly complex and can differ significantly from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job may require completely different actions and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined. Installations can likewise differ considerably, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. In many cases, totally new ductwork may need to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
