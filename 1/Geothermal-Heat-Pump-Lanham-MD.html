<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, unpredictable natural substances ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can cause unfavorable health conditions.

<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") explains how inside air can affect an individual's health, convenience, and capability to work. It can include temperature, humidity, absence of outdoors air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals. Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does offer standards about the most typical IAQ office complaints.<p>
<p>EPA's Total Direct exposure Evaluation Approach (GROUP) research studies discovered levels of about a dozen typical organic contaminants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside houses than outdoors, regardless of whether the houses were found in extremely commercial or rural areas. Additional GROUP studies indicate that while people are utilizing items including organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to really high toxin levels, and raised concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
