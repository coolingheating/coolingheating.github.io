For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
