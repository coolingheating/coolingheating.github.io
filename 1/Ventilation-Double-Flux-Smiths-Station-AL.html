<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably reduces direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Incorrect adjustment, typically indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue.
