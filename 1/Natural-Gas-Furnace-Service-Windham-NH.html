Reedy prefers the owners remain on and reinvest a part of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
