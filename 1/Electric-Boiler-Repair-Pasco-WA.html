Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up.
