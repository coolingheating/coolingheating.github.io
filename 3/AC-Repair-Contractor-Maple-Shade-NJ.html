<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Maple Shade NJ</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological contaminants are wet or wet building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Numerous fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and family plants.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
