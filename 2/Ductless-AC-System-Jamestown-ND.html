<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
