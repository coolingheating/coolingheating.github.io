However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level.
