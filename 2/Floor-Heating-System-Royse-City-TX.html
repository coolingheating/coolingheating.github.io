<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
