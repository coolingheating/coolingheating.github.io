<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
