<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions because they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
