<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
