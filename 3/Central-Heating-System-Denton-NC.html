For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal convenience inside.
