These signs may be promoted by poor indoor quality.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%.

Such info can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company.

Evaluation of this information might determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
