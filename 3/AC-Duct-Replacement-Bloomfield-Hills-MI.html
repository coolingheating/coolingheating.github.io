Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Bloomfield Hills MI</h3>

Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house.

Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
