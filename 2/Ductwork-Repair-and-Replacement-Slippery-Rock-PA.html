<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the problem and fixed really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>

<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices maker's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one response stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
