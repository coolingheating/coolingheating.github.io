<p>Among the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly pricey to set up, particularly in an older home. Depending on the type of unit installed, it can be loud and cause problems if you're extremely adverse dust. Furthermore, particular fuels and equipment may need special permits, and there is minimal flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators.
