<p>The toxins listed in this guide have been revealed to trigger the health effects mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the impacts noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels normally found in the house. In many cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health impacts is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed impacts could take place.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health problems triggered by biological toxins include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestive issues.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
