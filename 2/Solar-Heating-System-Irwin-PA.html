<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a big seller who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps an eye on energy intake and temperature levels in stores to save on expenses (particularly at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an acceptable range that might prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>The main reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the quantity of services used.
