During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item.

<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home.

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
