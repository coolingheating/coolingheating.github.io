Every maintenance task might need completely different steps and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being checked. Installations can also vary significantly, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. In some cases, totally brand-new ductwork may need to be set up in a structure that had none prior to.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results through a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
