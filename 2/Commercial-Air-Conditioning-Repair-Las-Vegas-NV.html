<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Company in Las Vegas</h2>

<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in Las Vegas Nevada</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
