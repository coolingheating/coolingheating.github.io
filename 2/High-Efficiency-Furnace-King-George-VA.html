<p>While contaminant levels from specific sources may not pose a significant health danger by themselves, most homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a major danger from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that many people can take both to decrease the threat from existing sources and to avoid new issues from taking place.

<p>These people have actually been great. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a home might cost. Recently I needed to contact these people two times. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
