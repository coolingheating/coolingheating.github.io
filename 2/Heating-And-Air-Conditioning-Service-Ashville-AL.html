<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Since it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
