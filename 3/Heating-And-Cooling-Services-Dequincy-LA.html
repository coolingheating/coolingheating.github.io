<h3>Electric Heating in Dequincy LA 70633</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>In this section, you'll go into higher detail about your company. You'll define your company's objective, plainly describing your company's purpose and issues it looks for to solve, your target market and consumers, and your special selling proposal (what makes you stand out from the competition).
