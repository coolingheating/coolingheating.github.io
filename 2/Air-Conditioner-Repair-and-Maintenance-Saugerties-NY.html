<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
