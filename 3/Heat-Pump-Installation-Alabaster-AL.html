<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
