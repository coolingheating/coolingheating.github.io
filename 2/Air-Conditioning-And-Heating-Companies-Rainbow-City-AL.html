<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
