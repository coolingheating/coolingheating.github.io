What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really helpful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
