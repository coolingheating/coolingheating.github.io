<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and therefore needs conditions ideal for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Remediation for Legionella break outs in commercial structures differ, however frequently consist of really hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in many cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive steps include adjusting typical hot water levels to permit 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, assessing center style layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and routine screening in suspect locations.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
