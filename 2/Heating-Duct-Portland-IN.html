<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
