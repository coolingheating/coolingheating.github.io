Nevertheless, both systems have a vast range of different elements for different applications in addition to a range of brand name and particular installation requirements.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.
