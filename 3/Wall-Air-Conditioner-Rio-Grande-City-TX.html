<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as medical facilities and skyscrapers, vehicles such as vehicles, trains, planes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
