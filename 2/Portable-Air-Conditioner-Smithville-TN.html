<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
