<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have numerous control boards. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and manage of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the new control board need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t properly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
