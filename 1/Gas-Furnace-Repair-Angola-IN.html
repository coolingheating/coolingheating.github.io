<p>Bear in mind that the SEER score is calculated using the same set of temperatures across the board. The average summertime temperature level to get to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the appropriate SEER rating for your location, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all brand-new air conditioning units made in the United States.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
