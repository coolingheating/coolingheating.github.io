Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal comfort indoors.
