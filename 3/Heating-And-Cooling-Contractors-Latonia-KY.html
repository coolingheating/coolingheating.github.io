<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipelines are seldom used due to long-term destructive concerns.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
