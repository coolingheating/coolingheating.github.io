<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on price. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
