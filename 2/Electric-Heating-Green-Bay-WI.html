<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Heaters are like automobiles. As they age, you can replace one part just need another part changed or fixed next year.

Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
