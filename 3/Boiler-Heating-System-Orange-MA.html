Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good opportunity; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>
