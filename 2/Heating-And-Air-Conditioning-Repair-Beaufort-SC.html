<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
