<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in Canton MS</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
