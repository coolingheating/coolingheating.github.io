<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales man comes to your home he exists to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and ought to not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Centereach NY Home</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing in some human beings exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might set off attacks in individuals with asthma. There is proof that some individuals can establish a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually likewise been revealed to cause cancer in animals and might trigger cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
