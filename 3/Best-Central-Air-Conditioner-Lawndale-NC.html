<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
