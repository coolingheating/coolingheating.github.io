<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
