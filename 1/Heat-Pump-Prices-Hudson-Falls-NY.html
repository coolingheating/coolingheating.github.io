<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering info on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
