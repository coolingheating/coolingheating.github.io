<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

In addition, the ground source heatpump is very resilient and can last you for many years with simply a really little quantity of maintenance, a big difference to the substantial maintenance a more conventional system needs. If a geothermal heatpump is appropriately set up, the geothermal ground loop is likewise long-lasting.

<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized various methods. The CMHC research study contacted several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they belonged to a research study, and the researchers did not control for time invested or techniques used. The EPA research study prescribed and managed techniques used on a smaller sized number of houses. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both research studies have defects, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the devices and methods used by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered because these research studies were carried out, the duct in homes have not.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
