<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
