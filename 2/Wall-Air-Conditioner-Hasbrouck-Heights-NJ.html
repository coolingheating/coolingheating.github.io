<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
