<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Greencastle IN 46135</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had spotted the difficulty area in examining the expense. He fixed the issue in one day, had actually adjusted the bill to what I thought about reasonable prior to he recalled, understood what might have triggered the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not take place once again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
