<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Johns Island South Carolina</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Picking the right size a/c is an essential part of the HVAC buying procedure and one that you'll require an HVAC expert to assist you with.
