<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Morgantown KY?</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on different home efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was remarkable. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the necessary electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
