I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
