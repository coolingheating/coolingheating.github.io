<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Pasadena MD</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
