<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
