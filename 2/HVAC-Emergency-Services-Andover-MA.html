<p>My eldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
