<h3>Appropriate Things To Consider In Your Old Greenwich CT Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
