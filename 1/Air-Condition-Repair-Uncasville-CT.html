<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been revealed to cause the health results mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the impacts kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed impacts might occur.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
