<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out.

Perhaps Real estate agents should think about too many variables to definitively mention what a radiant heat system may contribute to, or subtract from, any given asking price. That stated, property buyers aiming to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
