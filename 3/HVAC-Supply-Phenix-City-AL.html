<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
