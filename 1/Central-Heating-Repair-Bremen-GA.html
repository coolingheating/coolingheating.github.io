<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may end up being clogged up, reducing air circulation quality, distribution, and volume. They also may end up being locations for molds and germs to grow and be distributed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise must be correctly kept to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>
