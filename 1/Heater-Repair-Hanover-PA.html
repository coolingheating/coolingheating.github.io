If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
