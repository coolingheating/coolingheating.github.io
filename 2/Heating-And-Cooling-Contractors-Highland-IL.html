<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Highland IL</h3>
<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house.

Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate contaminants straight from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
