<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, especially given that we invest most of our lives inside. A/c unit assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
