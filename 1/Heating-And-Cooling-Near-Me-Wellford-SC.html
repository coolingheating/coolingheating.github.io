<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>

<h3>Ways to Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Wellford SC</h3>
<p>In-floor heater can come with specific health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you simply can't appear to heat up and find you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this issue due to the fact that they heat surface areas and not the air itself. Additionally, considering that they do not rely upon fans, ducts, registers and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heating systems can decrease the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
