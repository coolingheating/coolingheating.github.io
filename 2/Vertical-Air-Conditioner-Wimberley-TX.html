<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
