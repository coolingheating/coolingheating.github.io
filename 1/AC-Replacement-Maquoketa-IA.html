<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
