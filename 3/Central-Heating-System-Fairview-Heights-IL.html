<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Fairview Heights Illinois</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
