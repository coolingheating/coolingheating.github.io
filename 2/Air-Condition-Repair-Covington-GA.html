<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced.
