<p>I have actually been using them for years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly greater incomes for air conditioning tradespersons.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, or even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider potential impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system correctly changed.
