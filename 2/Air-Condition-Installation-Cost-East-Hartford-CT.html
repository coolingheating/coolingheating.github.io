<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
