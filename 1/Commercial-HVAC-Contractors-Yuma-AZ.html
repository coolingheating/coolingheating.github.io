Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
