<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
