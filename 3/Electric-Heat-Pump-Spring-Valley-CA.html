Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
