<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system.

We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
