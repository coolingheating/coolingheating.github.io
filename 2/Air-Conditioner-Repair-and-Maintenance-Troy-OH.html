<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
