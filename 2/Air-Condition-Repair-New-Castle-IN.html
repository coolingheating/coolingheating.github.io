<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be bought and utilized by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous individuals.<p>
