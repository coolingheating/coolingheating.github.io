<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can become clogged with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's performance. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can usually be performed in just a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
