Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the outside of the system and ensure that there is no rust, damage from built up wetness, or extreme wear to the exterior. They might recommend that you trim overgrown trees or bushes to ensure appropriate air flow around the unit.<p>
<p>For example, pollutants might collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting pollutants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outside pollutant, it might function as a pathway to bring the impurities inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working as well as it must-- if particles is blocking the outdoor air consumption, for example, or the filters are contaminated or improperly maintained.<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
