<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractor in North Fort Myers</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings build up indoors, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
