<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>To set up a safe consultation or appointment with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your area in an online search.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
