<p>There are 2 primary types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating service. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy costs, and has more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological concerns. Additionally, enhancements to the HVAC system efficiency can likewise help increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the United States, the EPA has enforced tighter constraints for many years. There are numerous approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>

A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, variety in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps typically need excavation to install, which adds numerous thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
