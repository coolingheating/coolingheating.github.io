<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Harrison Township MI 48045</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working, integrity Energy was fast to respond. They appeared the next day and replaced two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heating systems can heat the house. Honestly, our home heater is made complex, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
