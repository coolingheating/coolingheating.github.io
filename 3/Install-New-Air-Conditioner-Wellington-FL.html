<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
