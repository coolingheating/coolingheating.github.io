If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>

However the chances are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
