<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.
