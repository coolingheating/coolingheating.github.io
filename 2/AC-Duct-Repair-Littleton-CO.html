<p>When the level of new building and construction activity declines, service technicians who specialize in brand-new installation work may experience periods of unemployment. Maintenance and repair work, nevertheless, usually remains fairly steady.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
