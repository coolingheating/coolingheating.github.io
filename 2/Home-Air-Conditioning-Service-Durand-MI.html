They weren't cheap however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.
