<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
