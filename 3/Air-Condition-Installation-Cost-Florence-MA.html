<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Florence MA?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
