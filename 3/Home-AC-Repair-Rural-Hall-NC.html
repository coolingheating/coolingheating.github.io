<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually just available for larger homes due to their high power and capability.

Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
