<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the increase it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a vehicle radiator or common home air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
