<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Shallotte NC Home</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very happy that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>

<h3>Heat And Air Units Repair in Shallotte NC 28470</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short cycling in really cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. In some cases, the furnace will just run harder to keep a warm environment for your house when the weather condition is incredibly cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our professionals if you require clearness on this problem.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and perhaps refrigerant is low, it will not be working at maximum performance and could overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy costs to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your house. If the system is too small, it will need to work harder and may get too hot. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
