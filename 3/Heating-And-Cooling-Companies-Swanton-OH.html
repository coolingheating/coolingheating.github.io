<p>There are numerous reasons that this can take place. The good news is that you can address much of these aspects by yourself without the requirement to call for expert assistance.

An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
