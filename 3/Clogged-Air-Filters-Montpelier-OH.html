For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>They were great! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested.
