<p>Many well and city water does not usually include lead. Water normally gets lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made with lead products. The only method to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean easily, especially if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They are accountable for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned up and replaced frequently. The heating and cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will worsen. Examining and changing the air filters is among the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically important to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative should request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this data may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
