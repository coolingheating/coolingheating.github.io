<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately harden and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
