<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
