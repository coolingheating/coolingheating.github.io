<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
