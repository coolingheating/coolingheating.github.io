<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
