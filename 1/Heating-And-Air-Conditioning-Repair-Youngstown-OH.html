<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes.

If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

Seek Advice From the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax reductions readily available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heating system where you live.<p>
