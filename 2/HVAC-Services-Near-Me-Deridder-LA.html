<p>Are you including a brand-new room onto your house? Possibly you have a space with special heating and cooling challenges, such as spaces that constantly appear to be too cold or too hot.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
