As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
