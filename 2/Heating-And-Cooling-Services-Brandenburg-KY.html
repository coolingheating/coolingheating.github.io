<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available. It is likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
