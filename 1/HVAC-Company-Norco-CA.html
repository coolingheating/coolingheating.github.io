<p>My oldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
