<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and harden-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
