<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, said Pueblo tries to find more than simply extra revenue or scale when it makes acquisitions - it searches for companies that can broaden Pueblo's customer base or provide a brand-new line of services. For example, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo carried out minimal pipes work for select customers. With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its abilities, allowing an enhanced value proposition for a wider set of customers.<p>
<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably minimizes direct exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Improper change, often suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Think about buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you acquire a brand-new gas stove or range. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your house. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
