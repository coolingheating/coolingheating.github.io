<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
