<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
