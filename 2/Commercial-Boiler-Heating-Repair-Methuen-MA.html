<h3>Ways To Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Methuen MA</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heatpump are typically set up in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their performance in time. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
