<p>The predominant health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
