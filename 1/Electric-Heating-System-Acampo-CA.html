Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work.

He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
