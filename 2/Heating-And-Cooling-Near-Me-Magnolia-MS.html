<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>The bureau projects 34 percent employment development for HVAC professionals between 2010 and 2020, more than two times the average for all occupations.
