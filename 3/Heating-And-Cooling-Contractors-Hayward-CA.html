There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
