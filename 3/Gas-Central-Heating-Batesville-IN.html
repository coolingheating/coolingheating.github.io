<p>Typically the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>

At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes mild impacts that are often mistaken for the flu. These signs include headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, disorientation and fatigue. The effects of CO exposure can vary considerably from person to person depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
