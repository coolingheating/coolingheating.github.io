<p>Check these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
