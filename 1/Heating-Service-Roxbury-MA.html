<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may notice unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
