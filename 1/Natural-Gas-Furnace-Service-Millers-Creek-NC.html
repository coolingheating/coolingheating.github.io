<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in Millers Creek NC 28651</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
