<p>Typically the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove private sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
