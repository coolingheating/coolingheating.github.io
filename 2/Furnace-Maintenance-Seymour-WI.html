<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
