<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
