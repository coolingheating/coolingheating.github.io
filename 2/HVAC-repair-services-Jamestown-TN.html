<p>Created to improve making process control in a printing plant, Carrier's creation controlled not only temperature however likewise humidity Carrier used his understanding of the heating of things with steam and reversed the procedure. Instead of sending out air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thus the quantity of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the work environment, and The Provider Air Conditioning Company of America was formed to meet increasing demand. In time, air conditioning became utilized to improve comfort in houses and automobiles too.<p>
