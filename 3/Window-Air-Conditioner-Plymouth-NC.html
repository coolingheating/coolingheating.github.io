<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window.

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which in little quantities is not harmful, but may become harmful if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms might likewise exist within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the entire office or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
