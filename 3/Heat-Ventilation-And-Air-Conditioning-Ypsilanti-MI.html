<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems.

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were helpful and handy, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better offer, for extraordinary service.
