Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less regular (but typically more major) cases of individuals becoming ill after remaining in a particular structure at a specific time.

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no pollutant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air may also be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area.<p>
<p>For contaminants aside from radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health symptoms or signs of poor ventilation and particular sources or contaminants have been recognized as possible reasons for indoor air quality problems. Testing for numerous contaminants can be expensive. Prior to monitoring your house for toxins besides radon, consult your state or local health department or experts who have experience in resolving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial structures.<p>
<p>Because it can help your system last longer, keeping your air conditioner is crucial.
