They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned and replaced frequently.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
