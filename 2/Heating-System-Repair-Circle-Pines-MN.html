<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
