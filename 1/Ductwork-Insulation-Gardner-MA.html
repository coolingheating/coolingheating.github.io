<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.
