<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
