<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are utilized to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal components too.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
