<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on unusual occasions.<p>
