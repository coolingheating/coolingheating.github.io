<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside your home.
