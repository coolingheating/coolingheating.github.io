<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
