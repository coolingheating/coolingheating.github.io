<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Fort Benning</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
