<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Belfair WA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. Many home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
