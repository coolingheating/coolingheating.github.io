<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
