<p>There's a huge distinction between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical type of house heating-- convection.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Use professionals and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated professionals perform better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. An ethical company does not exploit low-cost labor chances just because they're cheap. Affordable workmanship is generally inferior workmanship, and it never helps a company build long-lasting relationships with clients.<p>
