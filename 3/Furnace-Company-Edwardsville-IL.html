The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
