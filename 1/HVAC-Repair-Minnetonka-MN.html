<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>
