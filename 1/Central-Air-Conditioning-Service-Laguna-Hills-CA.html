<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
