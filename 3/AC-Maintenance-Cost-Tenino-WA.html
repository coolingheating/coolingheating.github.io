<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in effectiveness advantage. Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
