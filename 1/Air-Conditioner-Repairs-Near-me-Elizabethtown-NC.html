<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

However, choose your contractor wisely, a number of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda.

Evaluation of this information may determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
