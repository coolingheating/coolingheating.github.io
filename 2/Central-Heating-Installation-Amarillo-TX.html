<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Amarillo</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
