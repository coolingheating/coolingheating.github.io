<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
