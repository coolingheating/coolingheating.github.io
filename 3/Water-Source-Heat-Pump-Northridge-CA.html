<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Northridge CA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
