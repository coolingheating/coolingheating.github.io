<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on rate. It's hard to find a truthful AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
