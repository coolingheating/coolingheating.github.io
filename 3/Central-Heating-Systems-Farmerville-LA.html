<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends upon specific sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis may become stopped up, reducing air circulation distribution, quality, and volume.

She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
