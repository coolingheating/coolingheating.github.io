<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
