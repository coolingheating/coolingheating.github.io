<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>If it's time to upgrade an aging AC, variable speed is the way to go. Already planning to change an existing air conditioner? Assuming your budget accommodates a variable speed system, you need to certainly get one! You'll feel more comfortable throughout the summertime, and your indoor air will be whole lot cleaner. At the minimum, consider a two phase compressor for enhanced convenience and performance.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit conveniently into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Also, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to install the air conditioning system: Don't place it in an egress window that functions as the only ways of escape should a fire appear.<p>
<p>To begin, it's a great idea to think of energy effectiveness. By selecting a central AC unit that has as high of a performance rating as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run. Efficiency scores need to be labeled with all systems. While efficient systems might cost more, opting for an Energy Star-rated device is an excellent way to enjoy additional assurance.<p>
