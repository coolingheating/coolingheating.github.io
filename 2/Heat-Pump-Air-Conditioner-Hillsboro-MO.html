<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites should find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a harsh, harsh summertime.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
