<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and work environments matters, particularly since we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in extremely damp climates or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to utilizing a radiant heating system over a standard forced air heating unit. Radiant heating systems tend to be a lot more energy efficient than other heaters, for something. Required air heating systems tend to suffer from things like duct leaks, which rob them of up to 30% of their output.

<p>Air conditioning system can produce a great deal of water because they get rid of wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location.
