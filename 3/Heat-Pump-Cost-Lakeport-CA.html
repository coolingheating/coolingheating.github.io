<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance check outs per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and usually some other benefits. Some companies use priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
