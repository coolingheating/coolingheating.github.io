<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Important Company in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can imply considerable cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same period. Generally, SEER offers more data based upon how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
