<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, offices and schools matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the ac system will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
