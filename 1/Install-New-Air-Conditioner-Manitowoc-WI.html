<p>Variable speed is the method to go if it's time to update an aging AC. Currently preparing to replace an existing a/c unit? Assuming your budget plan accommodates a variable speed unit, you should definitely get one! You'll feel more comfy throughout the summer months, and your indoor air will be great deal cleaner. At the very least, consider a 2 phase compressor for improved convenience and performance.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
