Not just was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works however your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
