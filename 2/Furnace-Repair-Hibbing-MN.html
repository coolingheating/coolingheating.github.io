<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved issues. I would recommend this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Gas heating systems do come with some drawbacks. The biggest drawback is also the result of the combustion process. This process emits exhaust gases, consisting of carbon monoxide, which have to be vented to the outside of the house. Carbon monoxide is an odor-free gas, and is extremely toxic in greater concentrations. Because of this, a malfunctioning gas furnace or a venting issue could put your house's residents in genuine risk. It is extremely important to have your gas furnace routinely serviced, and to ensure your home has a carbon monoxide alarm set up.<p>
