<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is sincere, dependable, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Nick B. provided remarkable, customized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction design gets along, appealing and reliable. He plainly and completely explained all problems and repairs in a way that made me confident in his capability to resolve my repair problems.

He also responded to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a momentary fix to a problem that could not be resolved on the very first see due to not available parts.
