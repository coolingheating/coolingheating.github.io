<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
