Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>
