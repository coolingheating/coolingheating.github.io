<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
