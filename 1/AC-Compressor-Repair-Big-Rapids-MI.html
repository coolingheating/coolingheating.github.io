<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and work environments matters, especially considering that we invest most of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can generally be performed in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>As with most home enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heater can vary widely based on the size of the home. The majority of heating systems will last between 15 and 20 years.
