<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
