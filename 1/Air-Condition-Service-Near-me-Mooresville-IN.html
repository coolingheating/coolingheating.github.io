<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
