The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Numerous factors impact IAQ. These aspects include poor ventilation (absence of outdoors air), issues controlling temperature level, high or low humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering the structure. Sometimes, specific impurities like dust from construction or renovation, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals released as a gas over time) might cause poor IAQ.<p>
