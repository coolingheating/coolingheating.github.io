The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads.

Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
