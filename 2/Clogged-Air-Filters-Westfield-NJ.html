<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However much of the things individuals do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of airborne pollutants in their houses and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
