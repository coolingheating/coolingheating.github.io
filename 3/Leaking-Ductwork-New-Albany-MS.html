<p>Customer products that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive eliminators, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to trigger cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can cause symptoms associated with direct exposure to carbon monoxide. Carefully read the labels containing health threat information and cautions on the proper usage of these products. Use items that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use inside your home just if the area is well aerated.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A great place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one aspect (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at maximum efficiency and might get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also cause your energy bills to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not huge enough for your home. It will have to work harder and might get too hot if the system is too small. Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
