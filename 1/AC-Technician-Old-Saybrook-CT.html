<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit.

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
