This makes geothermal heating a trusted and readily available source of energy.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
