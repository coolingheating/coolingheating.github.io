<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractor in New City</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
