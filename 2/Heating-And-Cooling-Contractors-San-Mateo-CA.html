Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure products, smoking, family items, and using unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in manufactured items.

<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements.
