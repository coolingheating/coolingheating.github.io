<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Sterling Heights MI 48310</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do.

Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
