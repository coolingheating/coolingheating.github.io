<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, a number of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
