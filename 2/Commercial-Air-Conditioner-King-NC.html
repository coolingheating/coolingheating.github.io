<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter season can worsen issues. Stale indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too chilly to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather it is essential to be aware of a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must look out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
