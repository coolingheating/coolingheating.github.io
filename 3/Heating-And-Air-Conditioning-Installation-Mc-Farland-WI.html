<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter season can worsen issues. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is very important to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be hiding in your environments.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities.
