<h3>Choosing the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems in Albrightsville PA</h3>
<p>By continually establishing new ideas, Hutchinson can show you how to minimize your air conditioning, heating, and cooling costs.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
