The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be looked for leaks, the system should be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and gathered impurities (scaling in hard water locations). The systems should be inspected at least two times each year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to remove dust collected in order to improve collector performance.<p>
