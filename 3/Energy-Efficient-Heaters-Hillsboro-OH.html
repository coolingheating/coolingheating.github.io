<p>Sean was very useful. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
