Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, since the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not easy, since it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

Improperly located outside air consumption vents can likewise bring in air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
