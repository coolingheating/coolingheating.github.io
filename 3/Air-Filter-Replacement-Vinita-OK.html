<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
