<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
