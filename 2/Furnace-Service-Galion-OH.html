Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
