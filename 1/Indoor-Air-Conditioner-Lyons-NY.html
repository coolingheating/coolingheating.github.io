<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
