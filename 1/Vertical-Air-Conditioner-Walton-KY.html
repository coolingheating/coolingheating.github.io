<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down totally.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
