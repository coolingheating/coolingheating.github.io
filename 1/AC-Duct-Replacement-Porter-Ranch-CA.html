<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many common building products used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Since the fibers can be spread into the air during the elimination procedure, removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is typically suggested instead.<p>
