<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
