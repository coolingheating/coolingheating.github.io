<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and infants are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the destructive impacts of lead.
