<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company at Woodland Park CO</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
