<p>Circuit Board Replacement: √¢ $ " √Ç Most heaters have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace won√¢ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isn√¢ $ t effectively diagnosed, changing a board won√¢ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. It√¢ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
