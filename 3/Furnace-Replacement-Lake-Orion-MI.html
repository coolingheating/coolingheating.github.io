<h3>How to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Lake Orion MI</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Lake Orion MI 48362</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
