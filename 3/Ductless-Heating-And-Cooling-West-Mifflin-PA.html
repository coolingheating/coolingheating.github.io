Depending on the type of system set up, it can be loud and cause problems if you're extremely adverse dust. Additionally, specific fuels and equipment might require special permits, and there is minimal flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. During usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
