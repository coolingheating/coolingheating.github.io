<p>Utilize specialists and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated experts perform better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. Because they're inexpensive, an ethical company doesn't exploit cheap labor chances simply. Inexpensive workmanship is generally shoddy craftsmanship, and it never helps a company develop long-lasting relationships with customers.<p>

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
