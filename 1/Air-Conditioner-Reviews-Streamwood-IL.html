<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor environmental quality") explains how within air can impact a person's health, capability, and comfort to work.

Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
