<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become obstructed with particles that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Monee IL?</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home building is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofs.

The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
