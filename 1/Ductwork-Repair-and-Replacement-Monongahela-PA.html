<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
