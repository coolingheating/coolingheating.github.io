<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one ecological hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead goes into the body.

<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A great place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it!
