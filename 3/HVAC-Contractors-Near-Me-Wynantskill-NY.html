<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be brought on as the result of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation. Work environment temperatures ought to be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air flow should be avoided.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to comprehend and maintain.<p>
