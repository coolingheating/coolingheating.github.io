<p>These guys have been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost. Just recently I required to contact these people two times. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, its a business model they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to preserving a proper temperature.<p>
<p>We have been extremely happy with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has actually worked very well and is so efficient that it substantially reduced our utility expenditures - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we require them for emergency situations they responded quickly and solved the problem.<p>
