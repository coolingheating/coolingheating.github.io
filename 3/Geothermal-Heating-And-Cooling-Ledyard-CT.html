<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Ledyard CT</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We picked getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses.

<h3>Home AC Repair in Ledyard CT 06339</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the house. Pollutants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can show your house may not have enough ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To detect odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those procedures include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air outside. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
