<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>The primary health result connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
