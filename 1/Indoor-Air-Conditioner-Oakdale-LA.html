<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air.
