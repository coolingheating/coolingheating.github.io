<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Beachwood Ohio</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
