<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater incomes for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or merely a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average wages for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites must discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a cruel, terrible summer.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transfer the heat to the rooms. A lot of modern warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
