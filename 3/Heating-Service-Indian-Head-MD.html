<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in large commercial buildings can not be efficiently determined or corrected without an extensive structure examination. These examinations may begin with written surveys and telephone consultations in which building private investigators assess the history of occupant signs and structure operation procedures. In many cases, these questions may rapidly reveal the issue and on-site visits are unneeded.<p>
<p>While pollutants typically found in indoor air are accountable for many damaging impacts, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are necessary to produce particular health problems. People also respond very differently to exposure to indoor air toxins. Further research study is needed to better comprehend which health impacts happen after direct exposure to the average pollutant concentrations found in homes and which happen from the higher concentrations that occur for brief time periods.<p>
