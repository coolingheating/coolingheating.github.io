<p>All heater have some level of air filtration. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance.

<p>Immediate results might show up after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified.

<p>Indoor temperatures are often more tough to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently essential to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this data might identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
