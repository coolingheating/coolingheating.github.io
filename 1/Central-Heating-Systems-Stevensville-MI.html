<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The probability of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on specific sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to person.
