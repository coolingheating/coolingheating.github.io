<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Armonk NY</h3>
<p>In the last numerous years, a growing body of scientific proof has actually shown that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that people invest approximately 90 percent of their time inside. Therefore, for many people, the threats to health might be higher due to exposure to air contamination inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>
