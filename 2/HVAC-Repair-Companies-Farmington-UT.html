<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of many building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at reasonable energy expenses. Load computing is described as the Manual J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of an unit required based on BTUs, identifying the proper size of system for your house likewise depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
