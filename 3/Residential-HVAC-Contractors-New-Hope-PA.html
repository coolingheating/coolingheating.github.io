<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at New Hope PA?</h3>
<p>Convected heat systems are increasingly popular, especially in the past quarter-century as innovation has advanced, and the systems have shown themselves in dependability and economy. Unlike convection heating, convected heat systems have no ductwork and no air flow.

These undetectable electromagnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a house, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones until a balance is achieved.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
