<p>There are many actions a homeowner can require to choose products that will prevent indoor air problems from occurring - a number of them are discussed here. Initially, use exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, think about using solid wood items. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that an effective moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet.
