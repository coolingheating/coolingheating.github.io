The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>

So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
