<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
