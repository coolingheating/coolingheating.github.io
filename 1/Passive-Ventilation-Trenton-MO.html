<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one action stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated usage of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, causing fractures and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the component.  an extremely helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
