<p>Customer items that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to trigger cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide in the body and can trigger signs connected with exposure to carbon monoxide.

<p>We take a look at clues before we offer suggestions to change instead of repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but numerous use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better option. If the existing system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
