<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in effectiveness benefit. Due to the fact that they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions.
