<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions.

Stale air may likewise be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location.<p>
<p>In many cases, if materials have failed to dry out a number of days after the suspected water event, mold growth is presumed within wall cavities even if it is not right away visible. Through a mold investigation, which may include harmful assessment, one should have the ability to identify the existence or lack of mold. In a scenario where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold removal may be required. Mold testing and examinations must be carried out by an independent investigator to avoid any dispute of interest and to insure accurate results; free mold testing used by removal companies is not recommended.<p>
<p>Regularly, however, investigators will need to come to the structure to perform personal interviews with occupants, to search for possible sources of the issues, and to check the design and operation of the ventilation system and other structure features. Since taking measurements of pollutants at the very low levels frequently found in office buildings is pricey and may not yield info readily useful in determining issue sources, detectives might not take numerous measurements. The procedure of fixing indoor air quality problems that lead to health and convenience problems can be a sluggish one, including a number of trial solutions before effective remedial actions are recognized.<p>
