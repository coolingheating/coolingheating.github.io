<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to keep and comprehend.<p>
