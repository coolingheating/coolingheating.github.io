<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Saint Helena CA 94574</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
