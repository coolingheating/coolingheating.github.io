<h3>Commercial HVAC in Blairstown NJ 07825</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
