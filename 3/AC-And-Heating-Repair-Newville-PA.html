<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for greater air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air purification technologies are becoming more common as offered solutions in residential and commercial HVAC product packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been widespread, as customers remain mainly oblivious to the results of air quality on health and performance.<p>
