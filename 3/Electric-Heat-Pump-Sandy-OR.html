<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>As you typically require to apply a self-leveling substance on top of the electric underfloor heater, you need to factor in the time it takes for this to entirely dry before the flooring covering can be put in place - this is typically a day or more.
