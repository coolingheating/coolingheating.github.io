<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Grass Lake Michigan</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
