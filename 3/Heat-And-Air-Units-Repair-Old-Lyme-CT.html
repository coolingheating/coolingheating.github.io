<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
