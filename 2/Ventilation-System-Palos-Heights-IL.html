<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Palos Heights IL</h3>
<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
