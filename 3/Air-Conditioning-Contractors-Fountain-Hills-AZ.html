The lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
