<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
