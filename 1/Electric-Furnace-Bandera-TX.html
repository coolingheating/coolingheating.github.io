<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

<p>There are a couple of main things that house owners will want to think about when choosing which of the very best AC units they should install in their homes. It really depends upon what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioner. The significant factors for most property owners will be the total cost to set up the best a/c unit brand names, life expectancy of the AC system, service warranties provided, energy effectiveness (SEER scores), and size of the system you need for your house's square video (LOTS) to efficiently cool your home.<p>
<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for property owners to think about. Often times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
