<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>The main reason property owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services offered. The cost might not be rewarding if the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's service warranty. Any significant repairs must be covered under the producer's warranty.
