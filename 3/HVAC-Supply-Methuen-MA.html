<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These products provide a danger only when they are handled in a way that creates dust including asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or interrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being airborne if proper controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for substantial illness.<p>
