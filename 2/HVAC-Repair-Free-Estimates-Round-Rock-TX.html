<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
