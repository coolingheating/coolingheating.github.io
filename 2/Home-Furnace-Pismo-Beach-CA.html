<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
