<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems in Fenton MO</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system before you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
