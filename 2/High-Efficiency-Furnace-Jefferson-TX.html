<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power must not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%.

Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.
