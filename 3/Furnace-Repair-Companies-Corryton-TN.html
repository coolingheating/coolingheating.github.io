<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
