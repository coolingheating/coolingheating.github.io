<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
