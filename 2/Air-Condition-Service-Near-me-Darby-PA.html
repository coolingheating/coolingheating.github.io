Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your employer should inspect measurements of temperature level, air and humidity flow.

A structure walk-through to look for smells and search for water damage, leaks, dirt or pest droppings may be handy. Leakages need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofings and in boiler pans can become infected with fungi or germs and need to be gotten rid of, likewise. In some situations, particular testing for radon or for asbestos may be needed as part of structure tenancy.
