<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
