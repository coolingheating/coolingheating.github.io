<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and therefore needs conditions appropriate for both organisms.

<p>Outside contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers.
