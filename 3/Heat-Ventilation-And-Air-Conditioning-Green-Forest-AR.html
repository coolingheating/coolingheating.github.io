From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some fundamental maintenance.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
