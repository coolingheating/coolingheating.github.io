<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

Not only was the price terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized.
