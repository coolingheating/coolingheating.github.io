<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
