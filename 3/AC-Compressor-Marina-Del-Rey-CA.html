<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Marina Del Rey CA</h3>
<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation organisation completely flip on its head the last few years. Winter utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
