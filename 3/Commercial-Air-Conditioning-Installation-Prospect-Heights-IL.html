<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems.

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
