<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
