<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will decrease the system's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.

Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
