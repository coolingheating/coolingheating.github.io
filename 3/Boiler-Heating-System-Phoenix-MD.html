<p>Ensure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else limiting the flow of air. Not only will obstructed vents and registers affect your comfort, they can also result in duct leaks due to excessive air pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused spaces is NOT an excellent idea. You will not save any money and will end up triggering more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities.
