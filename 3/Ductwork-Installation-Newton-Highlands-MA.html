<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Toxins could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and bacteria, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
