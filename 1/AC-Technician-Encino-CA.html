<p>Dometic's commercial grade roof a/c are performance-tested to overcome extreme or unusual road and weather conditions. Lots of basic units break down after simply four hours of severe vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel leading plate provides lasting strength while long copper lines decrease vibration and, therefore, noise too. While being among the hardest air conditioning unit around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, light-weight and capable of performing in any environment!

<p>. Before selecting the installation area of air conditioner, numerous primary elements need to be thought about.
