<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Dudley NC</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
