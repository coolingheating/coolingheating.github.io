<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines set up under the floor or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
