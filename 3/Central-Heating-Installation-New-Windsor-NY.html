<p>Some sources, such as building products, home furnishings, and family items like air fresheners, release contaminants more or less constantly. Other sources, related to activities carried out in the house, release toxins periodically. These include smoking, the use of unvented or malfunction-ing stoves, heaters, or area heaters, the use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, the use of paint strippers in remodeling activities, and using cleaning products and pesticides in housekeeping.
