<p>Its unique function is the existence of one main external system that connected to several indoor units.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
