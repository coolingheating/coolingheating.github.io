<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was sort of unusual being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed concerns. I would advise this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
