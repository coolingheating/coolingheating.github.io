<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
