At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system makers generally make rugged, high quality products. Begin by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the system cool off for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
