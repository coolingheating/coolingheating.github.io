<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors remove contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
