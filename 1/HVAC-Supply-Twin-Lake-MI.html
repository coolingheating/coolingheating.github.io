Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new furnaces can heat the house. Truthfully, our house heater is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
