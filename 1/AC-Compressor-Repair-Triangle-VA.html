<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
