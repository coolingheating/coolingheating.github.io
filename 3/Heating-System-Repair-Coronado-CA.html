<p>The primary factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services provided.

However, some makers require regular maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>Despite the type of electric radiant flooring heater, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or altered.
