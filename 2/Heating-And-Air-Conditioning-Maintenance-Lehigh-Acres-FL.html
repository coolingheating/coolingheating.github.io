Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
