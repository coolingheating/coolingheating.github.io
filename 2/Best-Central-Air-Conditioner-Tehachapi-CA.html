<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace in Tehachapi CA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
