<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a efficient and straightforward approach to lower ambient air pollution and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that best temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which typically includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
