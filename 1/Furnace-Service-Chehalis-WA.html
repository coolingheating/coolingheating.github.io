<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
