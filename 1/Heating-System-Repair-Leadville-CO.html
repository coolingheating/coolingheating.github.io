<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Facts That You May Not Know About a Boiler Heating System in Leadville CO</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
