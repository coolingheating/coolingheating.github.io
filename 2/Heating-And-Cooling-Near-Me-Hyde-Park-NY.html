<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was sort of weird being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with problems. I would advise this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
