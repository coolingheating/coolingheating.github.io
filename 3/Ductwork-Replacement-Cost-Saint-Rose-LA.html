<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
