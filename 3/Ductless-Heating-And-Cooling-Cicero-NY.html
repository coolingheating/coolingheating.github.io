The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to buy it. My wife stated that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have met in a very long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us. Please do.<p>
