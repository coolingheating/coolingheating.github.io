<h3>Home AC Repair in Sun Valley CA 91352</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
