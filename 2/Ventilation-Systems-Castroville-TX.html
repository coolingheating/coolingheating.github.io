<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation likewise depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in price from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps typically need excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
