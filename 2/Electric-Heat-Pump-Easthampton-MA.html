<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
