<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Dunn NC Home Owners</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house building and construction is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floors. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>

<h3>HVAC System in Dunn NC 28334</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
