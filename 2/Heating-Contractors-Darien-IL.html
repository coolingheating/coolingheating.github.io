<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
