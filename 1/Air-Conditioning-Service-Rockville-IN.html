<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place in time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
