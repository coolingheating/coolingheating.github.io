<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
