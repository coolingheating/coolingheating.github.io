<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Nipomo CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
