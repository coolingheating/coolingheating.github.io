<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
