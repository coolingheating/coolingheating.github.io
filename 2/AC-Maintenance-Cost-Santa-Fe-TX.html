The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>You ought to get your HVAC system visually checked a minimum of as soon as every year to ensure all the systems are working well. This inspection is a crucial element of HVAC maintenance. If you don't get your system examined, you will not see an issue till it stops working in the middle of winter.

Routine evaluation and maintenance also helps keep it in excellent shape and lengthens its life.<p>
