<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
