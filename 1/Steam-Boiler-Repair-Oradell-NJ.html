<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Air conditioner makers normally make rugged, high quality items. Start by examining any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool down for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>

<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square footage. They utilize a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs required to heat the space. The bigger the space, the more powerful the home heater needs to be.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
