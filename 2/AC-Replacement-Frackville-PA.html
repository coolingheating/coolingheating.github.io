<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the tools or skills needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician examine the system regularly.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak to your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
