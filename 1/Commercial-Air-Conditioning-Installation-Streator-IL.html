<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
