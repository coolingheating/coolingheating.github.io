<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time.
