<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
