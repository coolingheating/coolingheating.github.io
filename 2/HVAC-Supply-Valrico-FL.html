However, select your contractor wisely, many of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed house owners.

While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same).

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
