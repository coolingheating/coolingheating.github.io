<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Geneseo IL</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PLANS: Your HVAC system is an investment that spends for itself for many years, but only if you secure it to the very best of your ability. Thankfully, this doesn't have to be a chore! We take care of everything when you sign up for a Keefe's maintenance strategy. No matter what make or design of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual evaluations, discounted diagnostics, concern service, and remarkable deals on repairs and replacements.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
