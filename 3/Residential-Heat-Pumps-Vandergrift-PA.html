He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent.

If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400?

She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
