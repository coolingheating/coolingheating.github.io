<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are utilized to seeing this enter the backyards of houses.
