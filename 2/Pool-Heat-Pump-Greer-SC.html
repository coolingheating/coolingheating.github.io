<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two must not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
