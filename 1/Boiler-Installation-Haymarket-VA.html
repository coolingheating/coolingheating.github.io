<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
