<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps an eye on energy usage and temperature levels in shops to save on expenses (especially at night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the stores change beyond an acceptable range that could avoid customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
