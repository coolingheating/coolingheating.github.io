<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
