<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power should not surpass the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%.

Not just was the rate excellent however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
