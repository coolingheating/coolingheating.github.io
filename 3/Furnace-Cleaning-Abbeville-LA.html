<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
