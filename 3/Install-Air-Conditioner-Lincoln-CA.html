<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

Installing a new geothermal heat pump to deal with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
