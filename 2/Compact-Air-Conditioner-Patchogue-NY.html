Some buildings can also use natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outside air introduced into an area per an unit of time, and is frequently revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, air-conditioning and heating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>Immediate results may show up after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is just getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear soon after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities activate allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma.

Signs of health problems caused by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
