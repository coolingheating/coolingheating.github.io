<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
