<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
