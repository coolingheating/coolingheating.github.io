<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Litchfield NH</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
