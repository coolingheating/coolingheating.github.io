<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than models made 5 years back, so it makes financial sense to change or update your system if it's five years of ages or older. The very best central air conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the very same amount of cooling.<p>

<p>Radiant heat systems are increasingly popular, particularly in the previous quarter-century as innovation has advanced, and the systems have proven themselves in dependability and economy.

In a contained system like a home, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones up until a balance is achieved.<p>
