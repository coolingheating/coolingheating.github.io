<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
