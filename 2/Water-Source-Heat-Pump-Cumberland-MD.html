Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
