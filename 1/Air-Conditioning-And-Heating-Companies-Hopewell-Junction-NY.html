<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
