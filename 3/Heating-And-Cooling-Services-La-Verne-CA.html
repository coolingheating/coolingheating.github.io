<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can manage, many Seattleites need to discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
