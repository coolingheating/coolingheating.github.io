Because ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear really complicated at first, needing specialized tools, equipment, and know-how. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
