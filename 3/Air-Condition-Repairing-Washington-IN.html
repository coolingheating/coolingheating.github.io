<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room air conditioning offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
