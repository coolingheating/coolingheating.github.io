Other sources, related to activities performed in the house, release contaminants intermittently. These include smoking, making use of unvented or malfunction-ing stoves, furnaces, or area heaters, using solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, using paint strippers in redecorating activities, and using cleaning products and pesticides in house cleaning.
