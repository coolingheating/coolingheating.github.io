<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
