<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
