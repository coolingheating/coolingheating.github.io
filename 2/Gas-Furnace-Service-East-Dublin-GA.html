Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in East Dublin GA 31027</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
