<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
