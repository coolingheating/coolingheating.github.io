<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same.

Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly harden and cure-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
