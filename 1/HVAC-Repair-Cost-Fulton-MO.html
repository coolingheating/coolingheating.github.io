<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
