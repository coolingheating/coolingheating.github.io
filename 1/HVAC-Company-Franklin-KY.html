<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
