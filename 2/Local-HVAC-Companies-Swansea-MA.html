<p>Resideo uses a variety of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System services for both brand-new construction and retrofit applications.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.
