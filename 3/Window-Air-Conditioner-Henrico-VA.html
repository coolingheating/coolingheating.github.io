<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
