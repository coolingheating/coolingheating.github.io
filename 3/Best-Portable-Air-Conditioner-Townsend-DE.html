<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system. Loose, defective or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves inspecting the suggested connections as well as temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are safe and secure and tight.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
