<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Understand in Holbrook MA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater require fairly little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is vital to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed regularly to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in tough water areas). The systems ought to be examined a minimum of twice annually for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to get rid of dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
