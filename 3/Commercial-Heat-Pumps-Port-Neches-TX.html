<p>The toxins noted in this guide have actually been revealed to trigger the health results discussed. However, it is not always true that the effects noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels usually discovered in the home. In most cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed results could occur.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
