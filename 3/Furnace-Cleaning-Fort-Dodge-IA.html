<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can accumulate and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these illness do not show up until many years after exposure began. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothes and devices brought home from task sites.<p>

<h3>How To Soundproof a Central Heating System in Fort Dodge IA</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the growth of biological pollutants are wet or damp building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem caused by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Various fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and family plants.<p>

<p>Numerous commercial structures utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also make use of natural ventilation by opening windows or doors.
