<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
