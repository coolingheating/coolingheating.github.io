<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies heat from the floor up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires managed by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
