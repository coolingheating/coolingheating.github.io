<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
