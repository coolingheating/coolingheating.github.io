<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large merchant who asked not to be named because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to minimize expenses (especially during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an acceptable variety that could avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, there has actually been some promotion recommending that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is presently no proof, however, that a sensible number of houseplants remove significant amounts of toxins in houses and offices. Since overly moist soil might promote the development of microbes which can affect allergic individuals, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
