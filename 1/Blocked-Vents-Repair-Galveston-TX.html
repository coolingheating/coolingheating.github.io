<h3>Installation of HVAC in Galveston Texas</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your company should check measurements of air, humidity and temperature flow.

Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofs and in boiler pans can become contaminated with fungi or germs and require to be gotten rid of, also. In some circumstances, specific screening for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of structure tenancy.
