<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
